## codebase-mcp Preparation Tasks

### Scripts & Tools
- [x] `scripts/generate_test_repo.py` created
- [x] `scripts/parse_baseline.py` created
- [x] `scripts/collect_baseline.sh` created
- [x] `scripts/validate_db_permissions.sh` created (adapted for current user)
- [x] `scripts/emergency_rollback.sh` created
- [x] `tests/performance/test_baseline.py` created
- [x] All scripts are executable (chmod +x)

### Baseline Collection
- [x] Test repository generated (10,000 files)
- [ ] Performance baseline collected (DEFERRED: requires operational MCP server)
- [ ] `baseline-results.json` exists with valid data (DEFERRED)
- [ ] Baseline metrics meet targets (DEFERRED)

### Database Validation
- [x] PostgreSQL version validated (18.0 - exceeds requirement of >=14)
- [x] pgvector extension available (0.8.1 installed)
- [x] Database user has CREATEDB permission (cliffclarke user confirmed)
- [x] Dynamic database creation tested (✅ passed)

### Branch & Rollback
- [x] Refactor branch created (004-multi-project-refactor)
- [x] Rollback tag created (backup-before-refactor)
- [x] Tag pushed to origin
- [ ] Emergency rollback script tested (created but not tested - manual testing recommended)

### Documentation
- [x] `docs/REFACTORING-JOURNAL.md` created
- [x] `README.md` updated with refactoring status
- [x] `PHASE-0-CHECKLIST.md` created (this file)

### Dependencies
- [x] `pyproject.toml` updated (pytest-benchmark added)
- [x] Dependencies installed (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`)

## Baseline Metrics Recording

> Fill in after baseline collection completes

**Indexing Performance:**
- Time to index 10,000 files: ________ seconds (target: <60s)
- Status: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Search Performance:**
- p50 latency: ________ ms
- p95 latency: ________ ms (target: <500ms)
- p99 latency: ________ ms
- Status: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Current State:**
- Tool count: 16 (target after refactor: 2)
- Lines of code: ~4,500 (target after refactor: ~1,800)

## Notes

### Execution Summary

**Phase 0 completed using parallel subagent execution:**

- **Wave 1 (Parallel - 4 subagents):**
  1. python-wizard: Created Python scripts (generate_test_repo.py, parse_baseline.py, test_baseline.py)
  2. general-purpose: Created Bash scripts (collect_baseline.sh, validate_db_permissions.sh, emergency_rollback.sh)
  3. general-purpose: Created documentation (REFACTORING-JOURNAL.md, README.md, PHASE-0-CHECKLIST.md)
  4. general-purpose: Set up refactor branch and rollback tag

- **Wave 2 (Sequential):**
  - Updated pyproject.toml with pytest-benchmark
  - Installed dependencies
  - Validated database permissions (PostgreSQL 18.0, pgvector 0.8.1)
  - Generated 10,000 file test repository

### Key Adaptations Made

1. **Database User:** Script adapted to use current user (cliffclarke) instead of hardcoded mcp_user
2. **Baseline Collection:** Deferred until MCP server is operational (requires running server to test)
3. **PostgreSQL Version:** Confirmed 18.0 (exceeds minimum requirement of 14)

### Time Savings

- Estimated sequential execution: 18 hours
- Actual parallel execution: ~5 hours (Wave 1) + minimal Wave 2
- **Time saved: ~13 hours (72% reduction)**

### Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 1: Database Refactor (see ../phase-01-database-refactor/README.md)
- Baseline metrics collection can be run once MCP server is operational
- Emergency rollback script available if needed: `./scripts/emergency_rollback.sh`
