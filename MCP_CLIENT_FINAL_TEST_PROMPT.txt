FEATURE 003 MCP TOOLS - FINAL VALIDATION TEST

This is the final test before merging to main. Two enhancements have been made:

✅ ENHANCEMENT #1: Query Response Format
   - Modified: src/mcp/tools/work_items.py
   - Change: query_work_item now includes explicit ancestors and descendants arrays
   - Impact: Test 5 should now return full hierarchy information as expected

✅ ENHANCEMENT #2: Metadata Schema Documentation
   - Created: specs/003-database-backed-project/METADATA_SCHEMAS.md
   - Content: Comprehensive documentation of required metadata for each work item type
   - Impact: Developers now have clear reference for creating work items

VALIDATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Please run Test 5 from the original test suite with enhanced verification:

TEST 5 (ENHANCED): Query Work Item with Full Hierarchy

1. Query the task work item created in Test 4 with hierarchy:
   ```
   query_work_item(
     id="<task_id_from_test_4>",
     include_children=true,
     include_dependencies=false
   )
   ```

2. Verify response now includes:
   - ✅ Basic work item fields (id, title, status, depth, path)
   - ✅ **NEW**: "ancestors" array with 2 items (project → session)
   - ✅ **NEW**: "descendants" array (empty for leaf task)

3. Expected "ancestors" array structure:
   ```json
   "ancestors": [
     {
       "id": "<project_id>",
       "title": "Test Feature 003 Implementation",
       "item_type": "project",
       "depth": 0,
       "path": "/<project_id>"
     },
     {
       "id": "<session_id>",
       "title": "Test Session",
       "item_type": "session",
       "depth": 1,
       "path": "/<project_id>/<session_id>"
     }
   ]
   ```

4. Query the project work item with hierarchy:
   ```
   query_work_item(
     id="<project_id_from_test_2>",
     include_children=true,
     include_dependencies=false
   )
   ```

5. Verify response includes:
   - ✅ "ancestors" array (empty for root-level project)
   - ✅ **NEW**: "descendants" array with 2 items (session and task)

6. Expected "descendants" array structure:
   ```json
   "descendants": [
     {
       "id": "<session_id>",
       "title": "Test Session",
       "item_type": "session",
       "depth": 1,
       "path": "/<project_id>/<session_id>"
     },
     {
       "id": "<task_id>",
       "title": "Test Task",
       "item_type": "task",
       "depth": 2,
       "path": "/<project_id>/<session_id>/<task_id>"
     }
   ]
   ```

EXPECTED RESULTS:

✅ Test 5 should now return "ancestors" and "descendants" arrays
✅ Hierarchy information explicit in response (not just path/depth fields)
✅ All other tests (1-11) should still pass as before

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

1. query_work_item returns ancestors array when querying child items
2. query_work_item returns descendants array when querying parent items
3. Arrays contain summary information (id, title, item_type, depth, path)
4. Backward compatibility maintained (all 10 previous tests still pass)

REPORT FORMAT:

Please report:
- Does query_work_item now include "ancestors" array? (YES/NO)
- Does query_work_item now include "descendants" array? (YES/NO)
- Do arrays have the expected structure? (YES/NO)
- Did any previously passing tests break? (YES/NO)
- Overall assessment: PASS/FAIL

METADATA DOCUMENTATION REFERENCE:

For future work item creation, consult the comprehensive documentation:
- File: specs/003-database-backed-project/METADATA_SCHEMAS.md
- Includes: Required fields, validation rules, examples for all work item types
- Quick reference table for each metadata type (project, session, task, research)
