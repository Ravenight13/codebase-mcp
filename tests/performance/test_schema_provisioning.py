"""Performance test for schema provisioning (T025).

Tests first-time workspace provisioning meets <100ms performance target.

Test Scenario: Quickstart Scenario 8 - Performance (Schema Creation)
Validates: Workspace provisioning speed (schema + tables + indexes)
Traces to: research.md performance validation, FR-010 auto-provisioning

Constitutional Compliance:
- Principle IV: Performance guarantees (acceptable one-time provisioning cost)
- Principle VII: Test-driven development (validates performance requirements)
- Principle VIII: Type safety (mypy --strict compliance)

Performance Target:
- Total provisioning time: <100ms (schema + tables + indexes creation)
- Measurement method: pytest-benchmark with clean database state per iteration
- Acceptable one-time cost (subsequent operations use existing schema)

Implementation Notes:
- Uses pytest-benchmark for reliable performance measurements
- Creates unique project_id per iteration to measure fresh provisioning
- Includes schema creation, table creation, and index creation
- Tests the ProjectWorkspaceManager.ensure_workspace_exists method
