"""Resilience and error recovery integration tests.

Validates automatic recovery from database failures, connection pool exhaustion,
and port conflicts per Phase 6 User Story 4 requirements.

Test Coverage:
- T033: Database reconnection after failure (SC-008)
- T034: Connection pool exhaustion handling (FR-016)
- T035: Port conflict detection and error messaging (SC-014)

Constitutional Compliance:
- Principle IV: Performance guarantees and reliability
- Principle V: Production quality error handling
- SC-008: Automatic recovery from DB disconnections within 10s
- SC-009: Server failures remain isolated
- SC-014: Error messages guide users to resolution

FR References:
- FR-016: Queue requests when pool exhausted, return 503 after 30s timeout
- FR-025: Enforce timeout values (database connection: 10s, query: 5s, request: 30s)
