"""Integration test for workflow-mcp integration (T020).

Tests automatic project detection from workflow-mcp server with proper
HTTP client mocking.

Test Scenario: Quickstart Scenario 4 - Workflow-MCP Integration
Validates: Alternative Path (Workflow Automation Integration), Acceptance Scenario 4
Traces to: FR-012 (workflow-mcp query), FR-013 (graceful degradation)

Constitutional Compliance:
- Principle VII: TDD (validates workflow integration correctness)
- Principle II: Local-first (tests external service integration with graceful degradation)
- Principle V: Production quality (comprehensive integration testing)
