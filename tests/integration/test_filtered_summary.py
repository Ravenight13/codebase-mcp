"""Integration tests for list_tasks filtering with summary mode (Scenario 4).

Tests verify (from quickstart.md Scenario 4):
- Status filtering works with summary response
- Limit parameter works with summary response
- TaskSummary schema maintained when filters applied
- Empty results handled gracefully

TDD Compliance:
- These tests MUST FAIL initially because list_tasks returns FULL TaskResponse
  objects instead of lightweight TaskSummary objects
- Tests will pass once T005 implementation completes (summary mode feature)

Constitutional Compliance:
- Principle VII: TDD (test-first development, failing tests before implementation)
- Principle IV: Performance (<2000 tokens for 15 tasks, <200ms p95 latency)
- Principle VIII: Type safety (full type annotations, mypy --strict compliance)

- Add TaskSummary schema (5 fields: id, title, status, created_at, updated_at)
- Modify list_tasks() to return TaskSummary by default
- Add optional full_details parameter to list_tasks() for TaskResponse
- Update _task_to_dict() helper or create _task_to_summary_dict() helper
