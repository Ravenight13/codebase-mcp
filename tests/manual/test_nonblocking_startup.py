"""Test non-blocking database initialization during FastMCP startup.

This test verifies that the FastMCP server properly implements non-blocking
database initialization, allowing tools to be visible immediately while
database initialization happens in the background.

Test Requirements:
1. Tools are available immediately (before DB init completes)
2. Database initialization task is started in background
3. Tools wait for DB init on first call (transparent to user)
4. Timing proves non-blocking behavior (<500ms for tool list)

Constitutional Compliance:
- Principle V: Production Quality (startup validation, error handling)
- Principle VIII: Type Safety (full type hints, mypy --strict)
- Principle XI: FastMCP Foundation (FastMCP patterns, non-blocking startup)

Type Safety: All functions have complete type annotations.
