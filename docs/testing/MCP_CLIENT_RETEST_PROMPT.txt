FEATURE 003 MCP TOOLS - RETEST REQUEST

Both critical bugs identified in your previous test run have been fixed and pushed to branch 003-database-backed-project:

✅ FIX #1: SQLAlchemy Session Management Bug
   - Modified: src/mcp/tools/work_items.py
   - Issue: "Parent instance is not bound to a Session" errors
   - Solution: Safe relationship loading using sqlalchemy.inspect() API
   - Impact: All work item operations (create, list, query, update) now functional

✅ FIX #2: Status Value Incompatibility
   - Modified: src/services/tasks.py
   - Issue: Pydantic validation failures with new status values
   - Solution: STATUS_TRANSLATION layer for backward compatibility
   - Impact: list_tasks works with both old and new status values

RETEST INSTRUCTIONS:

Please re-run all 11 tests from the original MCP_CLIENT_TESTING_PROMPT.txt exactly as before.
