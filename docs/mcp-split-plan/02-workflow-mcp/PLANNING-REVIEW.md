# workflow-mcp Planning Review

**Reviewer:** Senior Planning Review Agent
**Review Date:** 2025-10-11
**Phase:** Initial Plan Review (Pre-Implementation)
**Documents Reviewed:** README.md, constitution.md, user-stories.md, specify-prompt.txt, tech-stack.md, entity-system-examples.md, implementation-phases.md

---

## Executive Summary

The workflow-mcp initial plan is **comprehensive and well-structured**, with strong constitutional principles, detailed user stories, and a sound technical foundation. The generic entity system architecture is innovative and the phased approach (Phase 1 Core → Phase 3 Complete) is logical.

**Overall Assessment:** The plan is 85% ready for implementation with some important clarifications needed around entity schema evolution, connection pool limits, and Phase 1/Phase 3 handoff criteria.

**Major Strengths:**
- Exceptional clarity on generic entity system with concrete examples (commission work, game dev)
- Strong constitutional framework with 12 well-defined principles
- Comprehensive technical stack documentation with performance justifications
- Detailed implementation phases with git strategy and acceptance criteria
- Multi-project isolation strategy is sound (database-per-project)

**Key Concerns:**
1. **Schema Evolution:** No documented strategy for evolving entity type schemas after entities exist
2. **Connection Pool Limits:** Risk of PostgreSQL connection exhaustion with 100+ projects (200 connection limit)
3. **Phase 1 Deliverable:** Unclear if Phase 1 alone provides sufficient value to codebase-mcp
4. **Error Scenarios:** Missing error handling details for database creation failures and connection pool exhaustion
5. **Performance Validation:** No documented plan for measuring p95 latency targets in CI

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Implementation)

### C1. Schema Evolution Strategy Missing
**Location:** entity-system-examples.md, user-stories.md (US-005)
**Issue:** No documented approach for updating entity type schemas after entities exist.

**Scenario:**
1. User registers vendor entity type with schema v1 (requires: status, extractor_version)
2. 50 vendor entities created with v1 schema
3. User wants to add required field "last_updated" to schema v2
4. What happens to existing 50 entities that lack "last_updated"?

**Impact:** Without schema evolution strategy, users cannot adapt entity types as requirements change. This violates Principle XII (Generic Entity Adaptability).

**Recommendation:**
- Add schema versioning to entity_types table (schema_version INT)
- Document migration strategies:
  - **Additive changes** (new optional fields): Allow without migration
  - **Breaking changes** (new required fields): Require migration script or reject
  - **Backward compatibility**: Validate entities against schema version they were created with
- Add user story US-023: "Update Entity Type Schema" with version handling
- Update entity-system-examples.md with schema evolution example

---

### C2. Connection Pool Exhaustion Risk
**Location:** tech-stack.md (Connection Pooling), implementation-phases.md (Phase 1)
**Issue:** Plan supports 100+ projects but PostgreSQL default max_connections=200. With 5 connections per project pool + 10 for registry = 510 connections (exceeds limit).

**Math:**
- Registry pool: 2-10 connections
- 100 projects × 5 connections/project = 500 connections
- Total: 510 connections > 200 max_connections

**Impact:** Server will fail to create connection pools after ~40 projects unless max_connections is increased or pools are closed for inactive projects.

**Recommendation:**
- Add connection pool lifecycle management:
  - Close project pools after N minutes of inactivity (e.g., 30 min)
  - Lazy-reload pools on next access
  - Track last_used timestamp per pool
- Document max_connections tuning in deployment guide
- Add monitoring: log warning when connection count > 80% of max_connections
- Update tech-stack.md with pool lifecycle strategy
- Add error handling: graceful degradation if pool creation fails (queue requests or return error)

---

### C3. Phase 1 Deliverable Value Unclear
**Location:** implementation-phases.md (Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria)
**Issue:** Phase 1 only delivers project management (create, switch, list projects). No entities, work items, or tasks. Unclear if this provides sufficient value to justify standalone release.

**Question:** Can codebase-mcp actually USE Phase 1 alone?
- Yes: codebase-mcp can tag code chunks with active project_id
- But: No entities to track vendor status, no tasks to reference

**Impact:** If Phase 1 is insufficient for codebase-mcp integration, development effort is wasted until Phase 3 completes.

**Recommendation:**
- **Option A** (Recommended): Merge Phase 1 + minimal entity system into single MVP phase
  - Include: create_project, switch_active_project, register_entity_type, create_entity, query_entities
  - Defer: Work items, tasks, deployments to Phase 2
  - Justification: codebase-mcp needs entity tracking (vendors) more than work item hierarchy
- **Option B**: Document concrete codebase-mcp integration use case for Phase 1 alone
  - Example: Tag code chunks with project_id, enable project-scoped semantic search
  - Prove value without entities
- Update implementation-phases.md with clearer Phase 1 handoff criteria

---

### C4. Database Creation Failure Rollback Missing
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-001), implementation-phases.md (create_project tool)
**Issue:** If CREATE DATABASE succeeds but schema initialization fails, project entry in registry is orphaned with unusable database.

**Scenario:**
1. create_project("commission-work") runs
2. INSERT INTO registry.projects succeeds
3. CREATE DATABASE workflow_project_<uuid> succeeds
4. Schema initialization (002_project_schema.sql) fails (syntax error)
5. Result: Project exists in registry but database is empty/broken

**Impact:** Orphaned projects break system invariants. Retry fails due to unique constraint on name.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement transactional rollback strategy:
  - Use registry transaction for project insert
  - On schema initialization failure: DROP DATABASE + rollback registry insert
  - Return structured error with rollback confirmation
- Add error handling details to implementation-phases.md (Phase 1, create_project)
- Add test case: test_create_project_schema_failure_rollback
- Document cleanup procedure for failed projects in deployment guide

---

### C5. Performance Measurement Strategy Missing
**Location:** constitution.md (Principle IV), implementation-phases.md (Acceptance Criteria)
**Issue:** Constitution mandates p95 latency targets (<50ms switch, <200ms work items, <100ms entities) but no documented plan for measuring/validating in CI.

**Questions:**
- How to measure p95 latency? (pytest-benchmark? custom decorator?)
- Where to store latency metrics? (CI logs? Database?)
- What happens on p95 regression? (CI fails? Warning?)
- How to simulate realistic load? (10K entities, 100 projects)

**Impact:** Without measurement strategy, performance requirements are aspirational, not enforceable. Principle IV becomes unverifiable.

**Recommendation:**
- Add performance testing framework:
  - Use pytest-benchmark for latency measurement
  - Create fixture to populate 10K entities, 100 projects
  - Measure p95 latency for each critical operation
  - CI fails if p95 exceeds target by >20% (constitutional rule)
- Add performance test file: tests/performance/test_latency.py
- Document performance testing in implementation-phases.md (Phase 1, Week 3)
- Add CI job: performance-tests (runs after integration tests)

---

## Important Issues (Should Fix)

### I1. Optimistic Locking Version Mismatch Error Details Missing
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-008), entity-system-examples.md (Optimistic Locking)
**Issue:** VersionMismatchError is mentioned but error response format is not specified.

**What should error include?**
- Current version in database?
- Expected version from request?
- Last updated timestamp?
- Last updated by user?

**Recommendation:**
- Define VersionMismatchError response schema:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "VersionMismatchError",
    "message": "Entity was modified by another user",
    "entity_id": "uuid",
    "expected_version": 1,
    "current_version": 2,
    "last_updated_by": "other-user",
    "last_updated_at": "2025-10-11T10:00:00Z"
  }
  ```
- Add to tech-stack.md (Error Handling section)
- Add to user-stories.md (US-008 acceptance criteria)

---

### I2. Entity Type Deletion Strategy Missing
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-005 to US-010), entity-system-examples.md
**Issue:** No user story or documentation for deleting entity types. What happens to entities when type is deleted?

**Scenarios:**
- User registers "vendor" type by mistake → wants to delete it
- 50 entities exist with type "vendor" → can type be deleted?
- Foreign key constraint: entities.entity_type REFERENCES entity_types(type_name) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Recommendation:**
- Add user story US-024: "Delete Entity Type"
  - Acceptance criteria: Only allow deletion if no entities exist with that type
  - Return validation error if entities exist: "Cannot delete type 'vendor': 42 entities exist"
- Document in entity-system-examples.md
- Add test case: test_delete_entity_type_with_entities_fails

---

### I3. Project Archival vs Deletion Distinction Unclear
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-004), implementation-phases.md (registry schema)
**Issue:** Registry schema has status='archived' and status='deleted' but no user stories explain the difference.

**Questions:**
- Can archived projects be reactivated?
- Do deleted projects drop the database?
- Should list_projects show archived projects by default?

**Recommendation:**
- Add user story US-025: "Archive Project" (soft delete, database intact)
- Add user story US-026: "Delete Project" (drop database, cascade delete)
- Update list_projects tool: Default excludes archived/deleted, include_archived=True shows all
- Document archival lifecycle in README.md

---

### I4. Work Item Depth Limit Validation Missing
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-012), implementation-phases.md (create_work_item)
**Issue:** Constitution states "up to 5 levels deep" but no documented validation for exceeding limit.

**Scenario:**
1. Create project (depth 0)
2. Create session under project (depth 1)
3. Create task under session (depth 2)
4. Create research under task (depth 3)
5. Create another work item under research (depth 4)
6. Try to create child under depth 4 item → **should fail but error not specified**

**Recommendation:**
- Add validation in create_work_item:
  - Check parent depth before insert
  - If parent.depth >= 4, return ValidationError("Work item hierarchy cannot exceed 5 levels")
- Add error case to user-stories.md (US-012)
- Add test case: test_create_work_item_exceeds_depth_limit

---

### I5. JSONB Query Performance with Large Nested Objects
**Location:** entity-system-examples.md (Performance Characteristics), tech-stack.md (JSONB Design)
**Issue:** GIN index performance assumes small-to-medium JSONB objects. No guidance on large nested objects (e.g., 10KB+ JSON).

**Scenario:**
- User creates entity with 10KB data object (large feedback_summary, embedded documents)
- GIN index overhead increases significantly
- Query performance degrades

**Recommendation:**
- Add JSONB size guidelines to entity-system-examples.md:
  - Recommended: <5KB per entity data object
  - Maximum: 100KB (PostgreSQL TOAST limit is 1GB but impractical)
  - If data exceeds 5KB, consider splitting into multiple entities or using external storage
- Add validation warning in create_entity if data size > 5KB
- Document in tech-stack.md (JSONB Design Patterns)

---

### I6. Task vs Work Item Relationship Unclear
**Location:** implementation-phases.md (project schema), user-stories.md (US-011 vs US-016)
**Issue:** Both tasks table and work_items table exist. Unclear if they overlap or serve different purposes.

**Questions:**
- Are tasks a legacy system to be merged into work_items?
- Why separate tables if work_items supports item_type='task'?
- Should users use tasks or work_items for task tracking?

**Schema shows:**
- work_items table with item_type='task'
- tasks table (separate)

**Recommendation:**
- **Option A** (Recommended): Merge tasks into work_items
  - Remove tasks table from schema
  - Use work_items with item_type='task' exclusively
  - Migrate planning_references, branches, commits to work_items.metadata
  - Simplifies architecture, reduces confusion
- **Option B**: Document clear distinction
  - tasks: Lightweight, git-focused (for /implement workflow)
  - work_items: Hierarchical, metadata-rich (for project breakdown)
  - Update README.md with when to use each
- Update implementation-phases.md (Phase 1, project schema) with decision

---

## Suggestions (Nice to Have)

### S1. Add Entity Audit Trail
**Location:** entity-system-examples.md, implementation-phases.md (entities table)
**Enhancement:** Track entity change history for debugging and compliance.

**Proposal:**
- Add entity_history table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE entity_history (
    history_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
    version INT NOT NULL,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    changed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    changed_by VARCHAR(100),
    change_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (change_type IN ('create', 'update', 'delete'))
  );
  ```
- Insert row on every entity create/update
- Enable "undo" functionality for entity updates
- Supports constitutional principle (Production Quality audit trail)

**Benefit:** Users can see "when did Canon vendor become operational?" and "who changed it?"

---

### S2. Add Project Tags/Labels
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-001, US-004), implementation-phases.md (registry schema)
**Enhancement:** Allow tagging projects for organization (e.g., "commission", "game-dev", "research").

**Proposal:**
- Add tags JSONB column to projects table
- Add filter to list_projects: `list_projects(tags=["commission"])`
- Enables grouping projects by client, domain, or team

**Benefit:** As project count grows to 100+, users need organization beyond chronological listing.

---

### S3. Add Entity Relationships/Links
**Location:** entity-system-examples.md, user-stories.md
**Enhancement:** Allow entities to reference other entities (e.g., game mechanic depends on another mechanic).

**Current Limitation:**
- game_mechanic entity has dependencies: ["Attribute System", "Dice Rolling"] (string array)
- No validation that "Attribute System" entity exists
- No query to find "all mechanics that depend on Attribute System"

**Proposal:**
- Add entity_links table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE entity_links (
    from_entity_id UUID REFERENCES entities(entity_id),
    to_entity_id UUID REFERENCES entities(entity_id),
    link_type VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (from_entity_id, to_entity_id)
  );
  ```
- Add query_entity_dependencies tool

**Benefit:** Rich entity relationships enable dependency graphs and impact analysis.

---

### S4. Add Bulk Entity Operations
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-006, US-008), tech-stack.md
**Enhancement:** Allow creating/updating multiple entities in single transaction.

**Use Case:**
- User imports 50 vendors from CSV
- Current approach: 50 separate create_entity calls (50 transactions)
- Proposed: bulk_create_entities([...]) in single transaction

**Proposal:**
- Add bulk_create_entities tool (transactional, all-or-nothing)
- Add bulk_update_entities tool (batch updates)
- Performance: 10x faster for large imports

---

### S5. Add Query Pagination Cursors
**Location:** user-stories.md (US-007, US-018), implementation-phases.md (query_entities)
**Enhancement:** Use cursor-based pagination instead of offset for large result sets.

**Current Approach:**
- query_entities(offset=100, limit=10)
- Problem: Offset 10000 scans 10000 rows even if only returning 10

**Proposal:**
- Add cursor parameter: query_entities(cursor="<opaque_token>", limit=10)
- Cursor encodes (entity_id, updated_at) for efficient keyset pagination
- Performance: O(limit) instead of O(offset + limit)

**Benefit:** Scalable pagination for projects with 100K+ entities.

---

### Edge Cases Identification

**Well-Documented Edge Cases:**
- Optimistic locking conflicts (entity updates) ✅
- Work item depth exceeding 5 levels ✅
- Entity data not matching schema ✅
- Concurrent entity updates ✅

**Missing Edge Cases:**
- Database creation failure → orphaned registry entry (see C4) ❌
- Connection pool exhaustion with 100+ projects (see C2) ❌
- Schema evolution after entities exist (see C1) ❌
- Entity type deletion with existing entities (see I2) ❌

**Missing Errors:**
- Database connection failures (transient vs permanent) ❌
- PostgreSQL max_connections exhaustion ❌
- CREATE DATABASE permission denied ❌
- Schema initialization syntax errors (see C4) ❌

**Error Scenario Coverage:** 50%

---

### Phased Approach Logic

**Phase 1 (Core) Rationale:** ✅ Sound but incomplete
- Establishes foundation (registry, connection pools) ✅
- Enables project switching for codebase-mcp ✅
- **Gap:** Insufficient value without entities (see C3) ⚠️

**Phase 3 (Complete) Rationale:** ✅ Logical
- Builds on Phase 1 foundation ✅
- Adds full workflow features (work items, tasks, entities) ✅
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria ✅

**Phase 1 → Phase 3 Handoff:** ⚠️ Needs clarification
- What deliverables must Phase 1 produce for Phase 3 to start? Unclear
- Can Phase 3 start before Phase 1 integration testing? Unclear
- **Recommendation:** Add handoff checklist to implementation-phases.md

**Overall Phasing Logic:** 85% (clear but handoff needs documentation)

---

## Correctness Analysis

### Phase 1 Delivers for codebase-mcp?

**Phase 1 Deliverables:**
- create_project, switch_active_project, get_active_project, list_projects
- Registry database with projects table
- Connection pooling per project
- NO entities, work items, or tasks

**codebase-mcp Integration Needs:**
- Query active project_id to tag code chunks ✅ (get_active_project)
- Track vendor status (operational vs broken) ❌ (needs entities)
- Link code to work items ❌ (needs work items)

**Assessment:** Phase 1 delivers **minimal value** to codebase-mcp. Primary need (vendor tracking) is in Phase 3.

**Recommendation:** See C3 - merge entity system into Phase 1 for meaningful integration.

---

### JSONB Patterns Correctness

**Containment Queries (@>):**
```sql
WHERE data @> '{"status": "broken"}'::jsonb
```
✅ Correct - Uses GIN index efficiently

**Path Queries (->>, ->):**
```sql
WHERE data->>'status' = 'operational'
```
✅ Correct - But less efficient than @> (full index scan vs index lookup)

**Array Contains:**
```sql
WHERE data->'dependencies' @> '["Attribute System"]'::jsonb
```
✅ Correct - JSON array containment works

**Nested Property Queries:**
```sql
WHERE (data->'test_results'->>'coverage_percent')::float > 80
```
✅ Correct - Requires cast but works

**Performance Implications:**
- @> with GIN index: ~5-10ms for 10K entities ✅
- ->> without index: ~100-200ms for 10K entities ⚠️
- **Recommendation:** Document which operators use GIN index in tech-stack.md

**Overall Correctness:** 95% (minor documentation gap on index usage)

---

### JSON Schema Validation Correctness

**Draft 7 Feature Usage:**
- type, enum, pattern, format, minimum, maximum ✅
- required, additionalProperties ✅
- Nested objects, arrays ✅

**Validation Library:**
- jsonschema Python package (reference implementation) ✅

**Validation Timing:**
- Entity creation: Validate before INSERT ✅
- Entity update: Validate merged data ✅
- Entity type registration: Validate schema itself ✅

**Edge Case:**
- What if schema is valid JSON Schema but nonsensical?
  - Example: `{"type": "string", "minimum": 5}` (minimum is for numbers, not strings)
  - jsonschema library will reject this ✅

**Overall Correctness:** 100%

---

### Performance Targets Realism

**Project Switching <50ms:**
- Registry query: ~1-5ms (indexed lookup) ✅
- Connection pool lookup: ~1ms (dict access) ✅
- Total: ~2-6ms ✅ Well within target

**Work Item Hierarchy <200ms:**
- Recursive CTE for 5 levels: ~10-50ms (depending on child count) ✅
- Materialized path ancestor query: ~1-10ms ✅
- Total: ~11-60ms ✅ Well within target

**Entity Queries <100ms:**
- GIN index lookup: ~5-10ms for 10K entities ✅
- Full table scan (no index): ~100-200ms ⚠️ At limit without index
- Total: ~5-10ms with proper indexing ✅

**Connection Pool <10MB Overhead:**
- AsyncPG pool with 5 connections: ~2-5MB ✅
- 100 projects × 5MB = 500MB total ⚠️ Higher than expected
- **Recommendation:** Test memory usage, may need pool size tuning

**Scalability (100+ projects):**
- Registry queries: ✅ No degradation (indexed)
- Connection pools: ⚠️ See C2 (connection limit)
- Database-per-project: ✅ No cross-project query overhead

**Overall Realism:** 85% (targets achievable with proper indexing and connection pool management)

---

### Optimistic Locking Design

**Version-Based Approach:**
```sql
UPDATE entities
SET data = $1, version = version + 1
WHERE entity_id = $2 AND version = $3
RETURNING *;
```
✅ Correct - Standard optimistic locking pattern

**Conflict Detection:**
- If version mismatch: UPDATE returns 0 rows ✅
- Application detects 0 rows, raises VersionMismatchError ✅

**Retry Strategy:**
- User must re-fetch entity, merge changes, retry ✅
- Document recommends this in entity-system-examples.md ✅

**Edge Cases:**
- Concurrent creates with same name: Handled by UNIQUE constraint ✅
- Version overflow (2^31 updates): Unlikely, INT is sufficient ✅

**Overall Correctness:** 100%

---

---

### Commission Work vs Game Dev Examples

**Sufficient for Implementation?** ✅ Yes

**Commission Work (Vendor Tracking):**
- Domain: Invoice extraction vendor status
- Fields: status, extractor_version, supports_html, supports_pdf, test_results
- Operations: Create, query by status, query by format support, update status
- Coverage: Create ✅, Query ✅, Update ✅, Multi-value filters ✅

**Game Development (Mechanic Tracking):**
- Domain: TTRPG game mechanics
- Fields: mechanic_type, implementation_status, complexity, dependencies, playtests
- Operations: Create, query by status, query by type, update progress
- Coverage: Create ✅, Query ✅, Update ✅, Array fields ✅

**Differences Demonstrated:**
- Different domains ✅
- Different field types (enum vs boolean, array vs nested object) ✅
- Different query patterns (status vs type) ✅

**Missing Examples:**
- Research domain (papers, citations) - would add 3rd domain diversity
- Relationship tracking (entity depends on another entity)

**Overall Sufficiency:** 95% (two strong examples, third domain would be nice)

---

### Relationship to codebase-mcp

**Documented Clearly:** ✅ Yes

**Integration Points:**
1. **codebase-mcp → workflow-mcp:**
   - Query get_active_project() during indexing ✅
   - Tag code chunks with project_id ✅
   - Example provided in user-stories.md (US-021) ✅

2. **workflow-mcp → codebase-mcp:**
   - Query search_code() when creating tasks ✅
   - Include code references in task metadata ✅
   - Example provided in user-stories.md (US-022) ✅

**Separation of Concerns:**
- codebase-mcp: Code intelligence (semantic search, embeddings) ✅
- workflow-mcp: Project management (work items, entities) ✅
- No overlap, complementary functionality ✅

**Gap:** No documented API contract for cross-MCP queries
- What if workflow-mcp is down? Does codebase-mcp fail or continue?
- What if codebase-mcp is not installed? Does workflow-mcp function?
- **Recommendation:** Document error handling for missing/failed cross-MCP calls

**Overall Clarity:** 90% (clear separation, missing error handling docs)

---

## Risk Analysis

### JSONB Flexibility Risks

**Risk 1: Schema Validation Bypass**
- **Scenario:** User creates entity with valid schema, later queries with incompatible assumptions
- **Example:** Entity created with status="operational", user queries for status="active" (typo)
- **Impact:** Silent failures, no results returned
- **Mitigation:** JSON Schema enum constraints prevent invalid values ✅
- **Severity:** LOW (mitigated by validation)

**Risk 2: Query Performance Degradation**
- **Scenario:** Large JSONB objects (10KB+) slow down GIN index
- **Example:** User embeds 5MB PDF in entity data field
- **Impact:** Query latency exceeds 100ms target
- **Mitigation:** Document size limits (see I5) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (needs documentation)

**Risk 3: Schema Evolution Complexity**
- **Scenario:** User needs to change required fields after 1000 entities exist
- **Example:** Add "last_updated" as required field to existing vendor schema
- **Impact:** Existing entities fail validation on next update
- **Mitigation:** Not documented (see C1) ❌
- **Severity:** HIGH (blocks evolution)

**Risk 4: Unindexed Query Patterns**
- **Scenario:** User queries nested properties without GIN index coverage
- **Example:** `WHERE data->'test_results'->'details'->>'log' LIKE '%error%'`
- **Impact:** Full table scan, 100-200ms latency
- **Mitigation:** Document which patterns use index (see correctness section) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (needs documentation)

**Overall JSONB Risk:** MEDIUM (schema evolution is critical gap)

### Database-Per-Project Pattern Risks

**Risk 1: Connection Pool Exhaustion**
- **Scenario:** 100 projects × 5 connections = 500 > 200 max_connections
- **Impact:** Server fails to create new pools, tools fail
- **Mitigation:** Not documented (see C2) ❌
- **Severity:** HIGH (blocks scalability)

**Risk 2: Database Creation Latency**
- **Scenario:** CREATE DATABASE takes 500-1000ms on slow disks
- **Impact:** create_project exceeds 1s target
- **Mitigation:** Documented target is <1s (realistic) ✅
- **Severity:** LOW (acceptable latency)

**Risk 3: Backup Complexity**
- **Scenario:** 100 project databases require 100 separate pg_dump commands
- **Impact:** Backup/restore operations are complex
- **Mitigation:** Not documented (missing deployment guide section) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (operational burden)

**Risk 4: Disk Space Growth**
- **Scenario:** 100 projects × 100MB/database = 10GB minimum
- **Impact:** Disk space exhaustion on small systems
- **Mitigation:** Not documented (no monitoring/alerting guidance) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (operational burden)

**Risk 5: Schema Migration Complexity**
- **Scenario:** Need to update project schema across 100 databases
- **Example:** Add new index to entities table in all projects
- **Impact:** Migration script must iterate 100 databases
- **Mitigation:** Not documented (no migration strategy) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (operational burden)

**Overall Database-Per-Project Risk:** HIGH (connection limit is blocker)

---

### Schema Evolution Challenges

**Challenge 1: Backward Compatibility**
- **Scenario:** Schema v2 requires new field, but v1 entities don't have it
- **Impact:** Validation fails on v1 entities
- **Solution:** Not documented (see C1) ❌
- **Severity:** HIGH

**Challenge 2: Forward Compatibility**
- **Scenario:** Schema v1 allows field X, but v2 forbids it (breaking change)
- **Impact:** Existing entities become invalid
- **Solution:** Not documented ❌
- **Severity:** HIGH

**Challenge 3: Migration Scripts**
- **Scenario:** User wants to update 1000 entities to conform to new schema
- **Impact:** Manual update_entity calls required (no bulk migration)
- **Solution:** Not documented (bulk operations in S4) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**Challenge 4: Schema Version Tracking**
- **Scenario:** Entities created with different schema versions mixed in table
- **Impact:** Need to track which entity uses which schema version
- **Solution:** Not documented (see C1) ❌
- **Severity:** HIGH

**Overall Schema Evolution Risk:** CRITICAL (must address before Phase 3)

---

### Performance Bottlenecks

**Bottleneck 1: Connection Pool Exhaustion**
- **Location:** 100+ projects with 5 connections each
- **Impact:** PostgreSQL max_connections limit reached
- **Likelihood:** HIGH (see C2)
- **Mitigation:** Pool lifecycle management (close inactive pools) ⚠️

**Bottleneck 2: Work Item Hierarchy Queries**
- **Location:** Recursive CTE for 5-level hierarchies with 100+ children per level
- **Impact:** Query time exceeds 200ms
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (depends on hierarchy fan-out)
- **Mitigation:** Materialized path + depth limit ✅

**Bottleneck 3: Entity Queries Without GIN Index**
- **Location:** Queries using ->> operator instead of @>
- **Impact:** Full table scan, 100-200ms for 10K entities
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (depends on user query patterns)
- **Mitigation:** Document which operators use index ⚠️

**Bottleneck 4: Registry Database Contention**
- **Location:** All project switches query active_project_config singleton
- **Impact:** Lock contention if 10+ concurrent switches
- **Likelihood:** LOW (project switching is infrequent)
- **Mitigation:** Caching (documented in user-stories.md) ✅

**Bottleneck 5: GIN Index Size Growth**
- **Location:** entities table with 100K+ entities
- **Impact:** GIN index size exceeds shared_buffers, cache misses increase latency
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (long-term growth)
- **Mitigation:** PostgreSQL tuning (documented in tech-stack.md) ✅

**Overall Performance Risk:** MEDIUM (manageable with documented mitigations)

---

### Integration Challenges

**Challenge 1: Cross-MCP Error Propagation**
- **Scenario:** workflow-mcp calls codebase-mcp.search_code(), but codebase-mcp is down
- **Impact:** Task creation fails or omits code references
- **Solution:** Not documented (see clarity section) ❌
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**Challenge 2: Circular Dependencies**
- **Scenario:** Both MCPs query each other, creating circular call chains
- **Impact:** Deadlocks or infinite loops
- **Solution:** Not addressed in plan ❌
- **Severity:** LOW (unlikely with documented use cases)

**Challenge 3: Protocol Version Mismatches**
- **Scenario:** workflow-mcp uses MCP v1.0, codebase-mcp uses MCP v1.1
- **Impact:** Tool invocation failures
- **Solution:** Documented (both use FastMCP + MCP SDK) ✅
- **Severity:** LOW (mitigated)

**Challenge 4: Local IPC Performance**
- **Scenario:** Cross-MCP queries add 50-100ms latency
- **Impact:** Tool calls exceed latency targets
- **Solution:** Not measured (see C5) ⚠️
- **Severity:** MEDIUM

**Overall Integration Risk:** MEDIUM (error handling is gap)

## Phase 1 Deliverables Assessment

### Does Phase 1 Enable codebase-mcp?

**Phase 1 Delivers:**
- create_project, switch_active_project, get_active_project, list_projects ✅
- Registry database with projects table ✅
- Connection pooling per project ✅

**codebase-mcp Needs from workflow-mcp:**
1. **Active project context** ✅ Delivered by Phase 1
   - get_active_project() returns project_id, name, metadata
   - codebase-mcp can tag code chunks with project_id
   - **Value:** Enables project-scoped semantic search

2. **Vendor status tracking** ❌ NOT in Phase 1
   - Query vendor operational status (broken vs operational)
   - Link code chunks to vendor entities
   - **Missing:** Requires entity system (Phase 3)
   - **Impact:** codebase-mcp cannot prioritize fixing broken vendors

3. **Work item references** ❌ NOT in Phase 1
   - Link code chunks to tasks/sessions
   - Find code for active work item
   - **Missing:** Requires work items (Phase 3)
   - **Impact:** codebase-mcp cannot suggest relevant code for tasks

**Value Assessment:**
- Phase 1 alone: **LOW value** to codebase-mcp
  - Can tag code chunks with project_id ✅
  - But cannot track vendors or work items ❌
- Phase 3: **HIGH value** to codebase-mcp
  - Full vendor tracking, work item linking

**Recommendation:** See C3 - Merge minimal entity system into Phase 1 for meaningful integration.

---

- [ ] Active project context persists across MCP sessions ✅
- **Gap:** What is "sufficient" integration? (see C3) ⚠️

**Overall Clarity:** 90% (integration sufficiency needs definition)

---

### Handoff Between Phase 1 and Phase 3

**Current Documentation:** ⚠️ Minimal
- Phase 1 ends Week 3
- Phase 2 is codebase-mcp (Weeks 4-6)
- Phase 3 starts Week 7
- **Gap:** No explicit handoff checklist ❌

**Missing Handoff Items:**
1. **Phase 1 Deliverable Verification:**
   - Are all Phase 1 acceptance criteria met? ❌
   - Is Phase 1 integrated with codebase-mcp? ❌
   - Are performance targets validated? ❌

2. **Phase 3 Prerequisites:**

**Recommendation:** Add "Phase 1 → Phase 3 Handoff Checklist" section to implementation-phases.md with:
- Functional sign-off (all tools working)
- Performance sign-off (latency targets met)
- Integration sign-off (codebase-mcp integration tested)
- Documentation sign-off (docs complete and accurate)
- Technical debt review (known issues documented)

**Handoff Documentation:** 20% (minimal, needs comprehensive checklist)

4. Bulk operations (nice-to-have)

**Overall Specification Quality:** 85% (excellent examples, missing evolution strategy)

---

### Entity Validation Rules Clear?

**JSON Schema Validation:** ✅ Clear
- Validation occurs at create_entity and update_entity ✅
- jsonschema library validates data against registered schema ✅
- ValidationError raised on mismatch ✅

**Validation Rules Documented:**

**Current Documentation:** ❌ NOT handled

**Scenarios NOT Addressed:**
1. Adding optional field to schema (backward compatible) ❌
2. Adding required field to schema (breaking change) ❌
3. Removing field from schema (breaking change) ❌
4. Renaming field in schema (breaking change) ❌
5. Changing field type (e.g., string → integer) (breaking change) ❌

**Questions NOT Answered:**
- How to version entity type schemas? ❌
- How to track which entities use which schema version? ❌
- How to migrate existing entities to new schema? ❌
- Can entities with different schema versions coexist? ❌
