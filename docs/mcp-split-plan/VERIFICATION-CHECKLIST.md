## Quick Start Verification

### For /specify Workflow

```bash
cd /Users/cliffclarke/Claude_Code/codebase-mcp/docs/mcp-split-plan/phases/phase-00-preparation
cat README.md
# Run /specify with README content
```

✅ Path verified

### For Direct Execution

```bash
cd /Users/cliffclarke/Claude_Code/codebase-mcp/docs/mcp-split-plan/phases/phase-00-preparation
cat HANDOFF-PHASE-0B-CODEBASE-MCP.md
# Copy-paste into new Claude Code chat
```

✅ Path verified

---

## Final Checks
