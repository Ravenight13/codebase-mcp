# /specify Prompt: Phase 05 - Documentation Overhaul & Migration Guide

## AI Agent Instructions

You are generating a feature specification (spec.md) for **documentation overhaul and migration guide creation** for the codebase-mcp server v2.0 refactoring. This specification must capture WHAT users need and WHY it matters, without dictating HOW to implement it.

### Pre-Flight Validation

Before generating spec.md, verify:

1. **Constitution exists**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` contains project principles
2. **Feature scope confirmed**: This is ONE feature (documentation update for v2.0), not multiple features
3. **User context clear**: Multiple personas with distinct documentation needs identified
4. **Phase context understood**: This is Phase 05 of a larger refactoring initiative (depends on Phases 01-04)

If any validation fails, request clarification before proceeding.

## Feature Context

### Original User Request

After completing the codebase-mcp refactoring from 16 tools to 2 tools with multi-project support, all documentation must be updated to reflect the new architecture. Users upgrading from v1.x need clear migration instructions explaining breaking changes, step-by-step upgrade procedures, and rollback options. New users need accurate documentation showing the simplified 2-tool API with multi-project capabilities. All references to the 14 removed tools must be eliminated, and the new connection pooling architecture must be explained.

#### Edge Case Workflows

Document how system behaves in these scenarios:

**Empty State - Fresh v2.0 Installation**
- Scenario: New user with no previous codebase-mcp installation
- Behavior: README.md provides complete setup from scratch, no migration guide needed
- Recovery: N/A (standard installation flow)

**Version Detection - User on v1.x Tries v1.x Instructions**
- Scenario: User on v2.0 accidentally follows v1.x documentation
- Behavior: Commands fail with clear error indicating version mismatch
- Recovery: Documentation links to migration guide from error context

**Migration Interruption - Upgrade Fails Midway**
- Scenario: Migration script fails during execution (e.g., permission issue)
- Behavior: Migration guide explains how to diagnose failure and resume
- Recovery: Rollback procedure restores to v1.x, user fixes issue and retries

**Configuration Mismatch - Insufficient PostgreSQL Connections**
- Scenario: Administrator sets MAX_PROJECTS=20 but PostgreSQL max_connections=100
- Behavior: Configuration guide warns about calculation: 20 pools Ã— 20 connections = 400 needed
- Recovery: Documentation provides formula and tuning guidance

**Documentation Discovery - User Can't Find Migration Guide**
- Scenario: User searches for "upgrade" or "migration" in documentation
- Behavior: README.md prominently links to migration guide in Breaking Changes section
- Recovery: Multiple entry points (README, CHANGELOG, release notes) point to guide

**API Reference Confusion - User Expects Removed Tool**
- Scenario: v1.x user looks for create_work_item in API docs
- Behavior: API reference clearly states "Removed in v2.0 - see migration guide"
- Recovery: Migration guide explains removal rationale and workflow-mcp alternative

**Environment Variable Error - User Forgets New Required Variable**
- Scenario: User upgrades without adding MAX_PROJECTS to .env
- Behavior: Server uses default value (10), documented clearly in config guide
- Recovery: Configuration guide lists all variables with defaults and descriptions

**Architecture Misunderstanding - User Expects Single Database**
- Scenario: User searches PostgreSQL for "codebase_mcp" database after indexing project "my-app"
- Behavior: Architecture documentation explains database-per-project naming: codebase_my-app
- Recovery: Documentation provides database naming convention and discovery commands

**Integration Timeout - workflow-mcp Unavailable**
- Scenario: User expects automatic project detection but workflow-mcp down
- Behavior: README.md documents fallback to default project with clear error message
- Recovery: Configuration guide explains timeout settings and fallback behavior

**Rollback Validation - User Unsure if Rollback Successful**
- Scenario: User executed rollback procedure but uncertain about success
- Behavior: Migration guide provides validation commands to verify v1.x restoration
- Recovery: Guide includes troubleshooting section for partial rollback scenarios

## Specification Generation Guidelines

### The Golden Rule: WHAT/WHY vs. HOW

**YOU MUST NOT INCLUDE:**
- Programming languages, frameworks, or libraries
- File paths or directory structures (except when documenting user-facing locations)
- Code implementation details or algorithms
- Database schemas or query patterns
- Specific technology names in requirements (acceptable in examples when documenting actual implementation)

**YOU MUST INCLUDE:**
- User workflows for each persona (step-by-step)
- Documentation requirements and completeness criteria
- Migration procedures with validation steps
- Configuration guidance with validation formulas
- Error scenarios and recovery procedures
- Measurable success criteria for documentation quality

### Abstraction Examples

**Implementation Leak** (WRONG):
> "Update README.md file at root of repository by editing markdown and committing to Git"

**Proper Abstraction** (CORRECT):
> "README must reflect accurate tool count and provide updated installation instructions matching v2.0 requirements"

**Implementation Leak** (WRONG):
> "Create docs/migration/v1-to-v2.md with markdown sections containing bash code blocks"

**Proper Abstraction** (CORRECT):
> "Migration guide must provide step-by-step upgrade procedure with backup commands, migration script execution, and rollback instructions"

**Implementation Leak** (WRONG):
> "Document asyncpg connection pool implementation details in architecture docs"

**Proper Abstraction** (CORRECT):
> "Architecture documentation must explain connection pool design, LRU eviction behavior, and MAX_PROJECTS enforcement"

### Quality Self-Check

Before finalizing spec.md, verify:

```
- [ ] Zero programming languages mentioned in requirements
- [ ] Zero frameworks or libraries specified
- [ ] File paths only mentioned for user-facing documentation locations
- [ ] User workflows described step-by-step for all personas
- [ ] All functional requirements testable with pass/fail criteria
- [ ] Success criteria use specific numbers and percentages
- [ ] Edge cases explicitly enumerated with user-facing behaviors
- [ ] [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers â‰¤ 3 (with valid justification)
- [ ] Technical writers or users could understand every requirement
- [ ] Review checklist 100% addressable
- [ ] Constitutional principles respected throughout
```

---

## Post-Generation Actions

After generating spec.md:

1. **Self-validate** against quality checklist above
2. **Scan for leaks**: Search for tech terms that shouldn't be in requirements
3. **Present summary** to user for review:
   ```
   Spec.md generated for Phase 05: Documentation Overhaul & Migration Guide

   - 35 functional requirements defined
   - 5 user personas documented
   - 10 edge case scenarios covered
   - 0 clarification markers (or list them if any)
   - Complete migration guide structure defined

   Recommend running /clarify if needed before /plan phase.
   ```
4. **Request approval** before proceeding to /plan
5. **Update status** to "Approved" once human validates

---

## Success Indicators

**This specification succeeds when:**
- Human reviewer approves without requesting major revisions
- Minimal implementation details found (acceptable in examples documenting real interfaces)
- All requirements testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria use specific, measurable numbers
- Edge cases cover realistic documentation and migration scenarios
- Review checklist 100% complete and validated
- Constitutional compliance verified (all principles respected)
- User workflows enable documentation testing (example verification, link checking)
- All personas have relevant documentation requirements addressed
- Non-technical stakeholders understand migration value

**This specification fails when:**
- Human requires complete regeneration
- Requirements too vague ("good documentation", "clear migration")
- Generic edge cases auto-generated without context
- Success criteria subjective and unmeasurable
- Missing critical user workflows or personas
- Scope creep beyond documentation (includes code changes)
- Technical jargon prevents user comprehension

---

## Constitutional Alignment Notes

This feature aligns with project constitution principles:

1. **Simplicity Over Features**: Documents simplified 2-tool design without feature creep
2. **Local-First Architecture**: Documents local PostgreSQL setup and database-per-project design
3. **Protocol Compliance**: Accurately documents MCP tool interfaces
4. **Performance Guarantees**: Documents configuration tuning for optimal performance
5. **Production Quality**: Provides comprehensive migration and configuration guidance for production deployments
6. **Specification-First Development**: This spec defines documentation requirements before writing docs
7. **Test-Driven Development**: Documentation requirements testable (link checking, example verification)

---

**END OF PROMPT**

Generate spec.md following this structure exactly. Maintain radical separation between WHAT users need (specification) and HOW to build it (implementation planning).
