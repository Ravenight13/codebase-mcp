# Phase Documentation Transformation Summary

## Research Findings: Spec-Kit /specify Requirements

Based on research of the Spec-Kit framework (https://github.com/github/spec-kit) and the project's spec-template.md, the /specify command expects:

### Key Requirements

1. **Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW**
   - Describe the core problem or opportunity
   - Explain user needs and business value
   - Avoid technical implementation details

2. **User Story Format**
   - Structure: "As a [role], I want [capability], So that [benefit]"
   - Focus on outcomes, not implementation
   - Multiple user stories for different stakeholders

3. **Acceptance Criteria Format**
   - Given/When/Then scenarios
   - Measurable success criteria
   - Clear definition of "done"

4. **Mark Ambiguities**
   - Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` for unclear requirements
   - Don't guess or make assumptions
   - Clarification handled by /clarify command

5. **Avoid Implementation Details**
   - No technology choices (those come from /plan)
   - No code structure or APIs
   - No "how to build it" content

## Transformation Approach

For each phase README, I:

1. **Extracted WHAT content**: Requirements, objectives, acceptance criteria
2. **Removed HOW content**: Technical implementation details, code examples, execution steps
3. **Created user stories**: Identified stakeholders and their needs
4. **Defined success criteria**: Measurable, testable outcomes
5. **Listed constraints**: Non-negotiable requirements
6. **Clarified business value**: WHY this phase matters

## Common Patterns Across All Transformations

### What Was Consistently Kept (WHAT/WHY)
- Problem statements (why this phase matters)
- User stories (what different roles need)
- Success criteria (what defines done)
- Constraints (non-negotiable requirements)
- Business value (why this benefits users/organization)
- Acceptance criteria (testable outcomes)

### What Was Consistently Removed (HOW)
- Specific commands and scripts
- Code implementation details
- File paths and directory structures
- Technical procedures and execution steps
- Tool usage examples
- Verification commands
- Rollback procedures (tactical details)
- Code examples and snippets

### Key Transformations
1. **Objectives â†’ Problem Statements**: Rephrased as user pain points
2. **Deliverables â†’ Success Criteria**: Focused on outcomes, not artifacts
3. **Execution Notes â†’ Constraints**: Extracted non-negotiable requirements
4. **Prerequisites â†’ Dependencies**: Mentioned as context, not instructions
5. **Technical Details â†’ Business Value**: Explained WHY, not HOW

## Usage Instructions

### For Each Phase

1. **Read the specify-prompt.txt file** in the phase directory
2. **Copy the entire content** to use with /specify command
3. **Run /specify** with the content as input:
   ```
   /specify <paste content from specify-prompt.txt>
   ```
4. **Review generated spec** for clarity and completeness
5. **Run /clarify** if ambiguities marked
6. **Run /plan** to generate implementation plan
7. **Run /tasks** to create task breakdown
8. **Run /implement** to execute tasks

## Validation

All 8 specify-prompt.txt files:
- Focus on WHAT and WHY (no HOW)
- Include 4-5 user stories per phase
- Define clear, measurable success criteria
- List constraints (non-negotiables)
- Explain business value
- Are self-contained (can be used independently)
- Are ready for copy-paste into /specify command

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Phase 00 prompt**: Run `/specify` with phase-00 content, verify spec generation
2. **Iterate if needed**: Refine prompts based on /specify output quality
3. **Execute workflow**: Use /specify â†’ /clarify â†’ /plan â†’ /tasks â†’ /implement
4. **Document learnings**: Note any improvements needed for future phases
