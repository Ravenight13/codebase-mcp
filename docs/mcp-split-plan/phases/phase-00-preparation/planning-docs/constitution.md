# Codebase MCP Server Constitution

## Preamble

This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles and constraints for the Codebase MCP Server. These principles guide all design decisions, implementation approaches, and feature development. Any violation of these principles must be treated as a CRITICAL issue in planning and analysis phases.

## Core Principles

### Principle I: Simplicity Over Features

**Statement**: The Codebase MCP Server focuses EXCLUSIVELY on semantic code search. Feature requests outside this scope must be rejected.

**Rationale**: A single-purpose tool excels at its core function. Complexity creep leads to maintenance burden, performance degradation, and architectural compromise.

**Constraints**:
- NO work item tracking, task management, or project management features
- NO deployment tracking or CI/CD integration
- NO vendor integrations or vendor status management
- NO code analysis, linting, or refactoring tools beyond search
- Tool surface limited to: `index_repository`, `search_code`

**Acceptable Deviations**: None. This is a non-negotiable principle.

**Enforcement**:
- Design reviews must reject features outside semantic search scope
- PRs adding non-search functionality will be rejected
- `/analyze` flags scope violations as CRITICAL

---

### Principle II: Local-First Architecture

**Statement**: The Codebase MCP Server must operate entirely offline with no cloud dependencies.

**Rationale**: Developers need reliable tools that work without internet connectivity. Cloud dependencies introduce latency, privacy concerns, and availability risks.

**Constraints**:
- Local Ollama instance for embeddings (no OpenAI, no cloud APIs)
- Local PostgreSQL database (no managed database services)
- All models downloaded and cached locally (nomic-embed-text)
- Configuration stored in local files (no remote config servers)

**Acceptable Deviations**:
- Initial model download requires internet (one-time setup)
- Documentation links to external resources (non-functional)

**Enforcement**:
- Integration tests run in airplane mode
- No API keys or cloud credentials in configuration
- `/analyze` checks for cloud service imports

---

### Principle III: Protocol Compliance

**Statement**: The Codebase MCP Server must implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification correctly via Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport with no stdout/stderr pollution.

**Rationale**: Protocol compliance ensures compatibility with all MCP clients (Claude Code, Cline, Zed, etc.). Stdout pollution breaks SSE communication.

**Constraints**:
- Use FastMCP framework with MCP Python SDK
- SSE transport ONLY (no stdio transport)
- All logging via Python logging module to files (not stdout/stderr)
- All errors returned as structured MCP error responses
- No print() statements or debug output to console

**Acceptable Deviations**: None during runtime. Development debugging via file logging only.

**Enforcement**:
- mcp-inspector validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Protocol compliance tests for all tools
- `/analyze` checks for stdout/stderr writes
- Pre-commit hooks block print() statements

---

### Principle IV: Performance Guarantees

**Statement**: The Codebase MCP Server must meet strict performance requirements for indexing and search operations.

**Rationale**: Slow tools disrupt developer flow. Sub-second search is essential for interactive coding workflows.

**Performance Targets**:
- **Indexing**: <60 seconds for 10,000 files
- **Search**: <500ms p95 latency (end-to-end, including embedding generation)
- **Embedding Generation**: <200ms for single query (batched: 50 embeddings <2s)
- **Database Queries**: <100ms for similarity search (with HNSW indexes)

**Constraints**:
- Batched processing for indexing (100 files/batch)
- Batched embedding requests (50 embeddings/batch to Ollama)
- HNSW indexes on embedding columns (not IVFFlat)
- Connection pooling for database (min 5, max 20 connections)
- Async I/O throughout (AsyncPG, aiohttp for Ollama)

**Acceptable Deviations**:
- First-time indexing on cold database (no indexes built yet)
- Ollama model loading delay (first request only)

**Enforcement**:
- Performance benchmarks in CI/CD pipeline
- Profiling on representative codebases (10k files)
- `/analyze` requires performance test results in plan.md

---

### Principle V: Production Quality

**Statement**: All code must meet production-grade standards for error handling, type safety, logging, and observability.

**Rationale**: Production systems fail gracefully, provide actionable diagnostics, and prevent runtime errors through static analysis.

**Constraints**:
- **Error Handling**: All exceptions caught and logged, never silently swallowed
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models for all data structures, mypy --strict passes
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context (project_id, operation, duration)
- **Validation**: Input validation at API boundaries (tool parameters)
- **Observability**: Metrics for indexing throughput, search latency, error rates

**Acceptable Deviations**: None. These are baseline quality standards.

**Enforcement**:
- mypy --strict in CI/CD (no errors allowed)
- Code coverage >80% (unit + integration tests)
- `/analyze` checks for unhandled exceptions and missing type hints

---

### Principle VI: Specification-First Development

**Statement**: All features must be fully specified before implementation begins. Specifications describe WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

**Rationale**: Clear requirements prevent wasted implementation effort, scope creep, and misalignment with user needs.

**Workflow**:
1. `/specify` creates feature specification (WHAT, WHY, success criteria)
2. `/clarify` resolves ambiguities via targeted Q&A (max 5 questions)
3. `/plan` generates implementation plan (HOW: design artifacts)
4. `/tasks` creates dependency-ordered task breakdown
5. `/implement` executes tasks with micro-commits

**Constraints**:
- NO implementation without approved spec.md and plan.md
- spec.md contains ZERO implementation details (no code, no APIs, no tech stack)
- plan.md validates against constitution at Phase 0 and Phase 1
- All `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers resolved before planning

**Acceptable Deviations**: Emergency hotfixes (must create retroactive spec within 24h).

**Enforcement**:
- `/plan` errors if spec.md missing or has unresolved clarifications
- `/tasks` errors if plan.md incomplete (Phase 1 not done)
- `/implement` errors if tasks.md missing

---

### Principle VII: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Statement**: Tests must be written before implementation code. All tests must pass before merging.

**Rationale**: TDD catches bugs early, validates requirements, and serves as living documentation.

**TDD Cycle**:
1. Write failing test (unit or integration)
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor with tests as safety net
4. Commit when all tests pass

**Test Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: All functions/methods with non-trivial logic
- **Integration Tests**: Tool implementations, database operations, Ollama interactions
- **Protocol Tests**: MCP compliance validation (via mcp-inspector)
- **Performance Tests**: Indexing throughput, search latency benchmarks

**Constraints**:
- Tasks in tasks.md follow pattern: Test task â†’ Implementation task
- No implementation task starts without passing tests
- CI/CD blocks merges if tests fail
- Coverage >80% (enforced by pytest-cov)

**Acceptable Deviations**: None. TDD is non-negotiable.

**Enforcement**:
- `/tasks` generates test tasks before implementation tasks
- `/implement` halts on test failures
- Pre-commit hooks run tests (fast unit tests only)

---

### Principle VIII: Pydantic-Based Type Safety

**Statement**: All data structures use Pydantic models. All code passes mypy --strict validation.

**Rationale**: Runtime validation catches invalid data at boundaries. Static type checking prevents entire classes of bugs before code runs.

**Constraints**:
- **Pydantic Models**: MCP tool parameters, database records, API responses
- **Type Hints**: All function signatures, class attributes, module-level variables
- **mypy Configuration**: `--strict` mode (no implicit Any, no untyped definitions)
- **Runtime Validation**: Pydantic validates all external inputs (tool calls, database reads)

**Acceptable Deviations**:
- Third-party library types (use `# type: ignore` with comment explaining why)
- Dynamic metaprogramming (rare, must be justified in code review)

**Enforcement**:
- mypy --strict in CI/CD pipeline (blocks merge on errors)
- Pydantic models for all MCP tool parameter schemas
- `/analyze` checks for missing type hints

---

### Principle IX: Orchestrated Subagent Execution

**Statement**: Implementation uses parallel execution of specialized subagents where tasks are independent.

**Rationale**: Parallel execution reduces implementation time. Specialized subagents focus on single tasks without context switching.

**Execution Model**:
- **Sequential by Default**: Tasks within same file run sequentially
- **Parallel When Safe**: Tasks marked `[P]` run in parallel if file-independent
- **Subagent Specialization**: Each subagent handles one task.md entry
- **Orchestration**: Main agent coordinates subagents, aggregates results

**Constraints**:
- Only mark tasks `[P]` if they modify different files
- No `[P]` for tasks with shared dependencies (database migrations, config)
- Fail fast: Halt parallel batch if any non-optional task fails

**Acceptable Deviations**: Serial execution during debugging (for clearer logs).

**Enforcement**:
- `/tasks` validates `[P]` markers against file dependencies
- `/implement` runs parallel-safe tasks concurrently
- Task failures logged with clear subagent context

---

### Principle X: Git Micro-Commit Strategy

**Statement**: Commit after EVERY completed task in tasks.md. All commits must represent working state (tests pass).

**Rationale**: Small commits simplify debugging, code review, and rollback. Working state ensures bisectability.

**Git Workflow**:
- **Branch per Feature**: `###-feature-name` (e.g., `001-multi-project-search`)
- **Micro-Commits**: One commit per tasks.md entry
- **Conventional Commits**: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, perf, chore
  - Example: `feat(search): add project_id filter parameter`
- **Working State**: All tests pass at every commit
- **Atomic Changes**: One logical change per commit (single file or tightly coupled files)

**Constraints**:
- NO commits with failing tests (CI would reject)
- NO "WIP" or "checkpoint" commits (squash before push)
- NO large commits (>500 lines changed, exceptions: generated code, migrations)

**Acceptable Deviations**:
- Database migrations (schema + data in single commit)
- Refactoring (rename across many files, single commit OK)

**Enforcement**:
- Pre-commit hooks run tests (fast unit tests)
- `/implement` commits after marking task `[X]` complete
- CI runs full test suite on all commits

---

### Principle XI: FastMCP and Python SDK Foundation

**Statement**: The Codebase MCP Server must use the FastMCP framework with the official MCP Python SDK for all MCP functionality.

**Rationale**: FastMCP provides ergonomic abstractions over raw MCP protocol. Using official SDK ensures compatibility and receives upstream updates.

**Constraints**:
- Import `from fastmcp import FastMCP` for server initialization
- Use `@mcp.tool()` decorator for tool registration
- Use Pydantic models for tool parameter schemas
- Use MCP Python SDK types for structured responses
- NO raw JSON-RPC handling or custom protocol implementations

**Technology Stack** (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- **Python**: 3.11+ (async/await, match statements, type hints)
- **MCP Framework**: FastMCP with MCP Python SDK
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension
- **Embeddings**: Ollama with nomic-embed-text (768 dimensions)
- **Database Driver**: AsyncPG (async PostgreSQL client)
- **Code Parsing**: Tree-sitter (AST-aware chunking)
- **Validation**: Pydantic 2.x
- **Type Checking**: mypy --strict
- **Testing**: pytest with pytest-asyncio

**Acceptable Deviations**: None. This stack is battle-tested and non-negotiable.

**Enforcement**:
- Dependency pinning in requirements.txt (no alternate implementations)
- `/analyze` checks imports for prohibited libraries (requests vs aiohttp, etc.)
- Architecture reviews validate FastMCP usage patterns
