# Refactoring Journal

**Project:** codebase-mcp
**Objective:** Refactor to pure semantic code search with multi-project support
**Started:** 2025-10-11

## Phase 0: Preparation (2025-10-11)

### Goals
- Collect performance baseline for regression detection
- Validate database permissions for multi-project architecture
- Create rollback procedures and safety measures
- Document pre-refactor state for comparison

### Baseline Metrics
> To be filled after baseline collection completes

- **Indexing time:** ___ seconds (target: <60s)
- **Search p50 latency:** ___ ms (target: <500ms)
- **Search p95 latency:** ___ ms (target: <500ms)
- **Search p99 latency:** ___ ms (target: <500ms)
- **Current tool count:** 16 tools (target after refactor: 2)
- **Current LOC:** ~4,500 (target after refactor: ~1,800)

### Pre-Refactor State
- **Branch:** 004-multi-project-refactor
- **Backup tag:** backup-before-refactor
- **Database architecture:** Single monolithic database (codebase_mcp)
- **MCP tools:** 16 tools (mix of search + project management)

### Rollback Capability
- Emergency rollback script: `scripts/emergency_rollback.sh`
- Rollback tag: `backup-before-refactor`
- Restoration tested: [PENDING - to be tested in Phase 0]
