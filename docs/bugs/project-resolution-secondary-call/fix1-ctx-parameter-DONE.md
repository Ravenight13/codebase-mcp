# Fix 1: Context Parameter Pass-Through - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Confidence:** 99% (High)

## Summary

Fixed missing `ctx` parameter in two MCP tool files that was breaking Tier 2 (session-based config) resolution when `get_session()` internally called `resolve_project_id()`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `src/mcp/tools/indexing.py` (Line 172)

**Before:**
```python
async with get_session(project_id=resolved_id) as db:
```

**After:**
```python
async with get_session(project_id=resolved_id, ctx=ctx) as db:
```

**Impact:** Primary bug fix for `index_repository` tool

---

### 2. Fixed `src/mcp/tools/search.py` (Line 210)

**Before:**
```python
async with get_session(project_id=resolved_project_id) as db:
```

**After:**
```python
async with get_session(project_id=resolved_project_id, ctx=ctx) as db:
```

**Impact:** Secondary bug fix for `search_code` tool (discovered during validation)

---

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ **Step 1:** Read `src/mcp/tools/indexing.py` - confirmed bug on line 172
✅ **Step 2:** Read `src/database/session.py` - verified `get_session()` signature accepts `ctx` parameter
✅ **Step 3:** Applied fix to `indexing.py` line 172
✅ **Step 4:** Searched ALL occurrences of `get_session()` in tools directory
✅ **Step 5:** Found second occurrence in `search.py` line 210
✅ **Step 6:** Applied fix to `search.py` line 210
✅ **Step 7:** Confirmed `background_indexing.py` does not have the issue (uses legacy `AsyncSession(engine)`)

---

## Function Signature Validation

From `src/database/session.py` (lines 686-689):

```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def get_session(
    project_id: str | None = None,
    ctx: Context | None = None,  # ✅ Context parameter exists
) -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
```

**Confirmed:** The `get_session()` function signature accepts both `project_id` and `ctx` parameters.

---

## Additional Findings

1. **Total occurrences fixed:** 2 (indexing.py, search.py)
2. **Other tool files checked:**
   - `background_indexing.py` - Uses `AsyncSession(engine)` directly, not affected
   - `project.py` - Does not use `get_session()`, not affected
3. **Both tools have `ctx: Context | None = None` in their signatures**, so the fix is valid

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Problem:** When `get_session()` is called without the `ctx` parameter, it internally calls `resolve_project_id(explicit_id=project_id, ctx=None)`. This causes Tier 2 resolution (session-based config via `.codebase-mcp/config.json`) to fail because the Context is required to:

1. Get the session ID
2. Look up the working directory for that session
3. Search for the config file
4. Resolve the project from the config

**Solution:** Pass `ctx` through to `get_session()` so it can pass it to `resolve_project_id()`, enabling all 4 tiers of resolution.

---

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ❌ Tier 1 (explicit ID): Works
- ❌ Tier 2 (session config): **FAILS** (ctx=None)
- ❌ Tier 3 (workflow-mcp): Works (but never reached if Tier 1 succeeds)
- ✅ Tier 4 (default): Works (fallback)

### After Fix
- ✅ Tier 1 (explicit ID): Works
- ✅ Tier 2 (session config): **WORKS** (ctx passed through)
- ✅ Tier 3 (workflow-mcp): Works
- ✅ Tier 4 (default): Works (fallback)

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Test:** Verify `get_session()` passes `ctx` to `resolve_project_id()`
2. **Integration Test:** Call `index_repository()` and `search_code()` with session-based config
3. **E2E Test:** Full workflow with `.codebase-mcp/config.json` resolution

---

## Confidence Level: 99%

**Why not 100%?**
- Need runtime validation to confirm the fix works in production
- Need to verify no other code paths are affected

**Why 99%?**
- ✅ Function signatures verified
- ✅ All occurrences found and fixed
- ✅ Root cause clearly identified
- ✅ Fix is minimal and targeted
- ✅ No side effects expected

---

## Next Steps

1. Run test suite to validate fix
2. Test with actual `.codebase-mcp/config.json` file
3. Monitor production logs for resolution behavior
4. Consider adding type checker rule to prevent this in future
