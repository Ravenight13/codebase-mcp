# Tasks: Documentation Overhaul & Migration Guide for v2.0 Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-v2-documentation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (completed), spec.md (completed), research.md (completed), data-model.md (completed), contracts/documentation-structure.yaml (completed), quickstart.md (completed)

**Tests**: Manual validation procedures only (FR-032, FR-033). Automated testing deferred to Phase 07.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story priority to enable independent documentation authoring and validation of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Documentation root: `docs/`
- README: `README.md` (repository root)
- Glossary: `docs/glossary.md`
- Migration: `docs/migration/`
- Configuration: `docs/configuration/`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture/`
- API Reference: `docs/api/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create directory structure and shared resources for all documentation artifacts

**Duration Estimate**: 2-3 hours

- [X] T001 Create documentation directory structure (docs/migration/, docs/configuration/, docs/architecture/, docs/api/)
- [X] T002 [P] Create glossary.md with 6 canonical terms (project_id, connection pool, LRU eviction, database-per-project, workflow-mcp integration, default project) - FR-034
- [X] T003 [P] Create markdown style guide document with formatting conventions (code blocks, heading hierarchy, table formatting, file naming) - FR-035

**Checkpoint**: Directory structure and shared resources ready for artifact authoring

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Common Sections)

**Purpose**: Sections shared across multiple documentation artifacts

**Duration Estimate**: 3-4 hours

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: These sections are referenced by multiple user stories and must be complete before artifact-specific work

- [X] T004 [P] Document all 14 removed tools with names and categories in shared reference (for Migration Guide and API Reference) - FR-010, FR-008
- [X] T005 [P] Document new environment variables table (8-10 variables with defaults) for Configuration Guide - FR-013, FR-021

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - provides shared resources
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P2) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P3) ‚Üí US5 (P3)
  - US2 and US3 can run in parallel (both P2, different files)
  - US4 and US5 can run in parallel (both P3, different files)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Migration Guide**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - HIGHEST PRIORITY, MUST COMPLETE FIRST
- **User Story 2 (P2) - README**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May reference Migration Guide (US1) but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2) - Configuration Guide**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May reference Migration Guide (US1) for env vars but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P3) - API Reference**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - References removed tools list from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Architecture Docs**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Review validation procedures BEFORE authoring (understand success criteria)
- Write content sections in order (follow contract structure)
- Validate content AFTER authoring (manual testing procedures)
- Complete all validation tasks before marking story complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel (glossary and style guide are independent)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: T004, T005, and T006 can run in parallel (shared sections for different artifacts)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Within Migration Guide, some sections can be written in parallel once structure is defined
- **Phase 4 and Phase 5**: US2 (README) and US3 (Configuration Guide) can run in parallel - both P2 priority, different files
- **Phase 6 and Phase 7**: US4 (API Reference) and US5 (Architecture Docs) can run in parallel - both P3 priority, different files
  - Within API Reference (US4): T060, T061, T062, T064 can run in parallel (different tool sections)
  - Within Architecture Docs (US5): T071, T072 can run in parallel (overview and diagrams are independent)
- **Phase 8 Polish**: T082 and T083 can run in parallel (link verification and code example testing are independent validation procedures)

2. Add User Story 1 (P1) - Migration Guide (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí ~10-12 hours ‚Üí **DELIVER MVP**
3. Add User Story 2 (P2) - README (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí ~6-8 hours ‚Üí **DELIVER for new users**
4. Add User Story 3 (P2) - Configuration Guide (Phase 5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí ~8-10 hours ‚Üí **DELIVER for administrators**
5. Add User Story 4 (P3) - API Reference (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí ~6-8 hours ‚Üí **DELIVER for developers**
6. Add User Story 5 (P3) - Architecture Docs (Phase 7) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí ~6-8 hours ‚Üí **DELIVER for maintainers**
7. Add Polish (Phase 8) ‚Üí Final validation and consistency ‚Üí ~4-6 hours ‚Üí **COMPLETE documentation overhaul**

**Total Estimated Duration**: ~45-60 hours for complete documentation overhaul across all 5 user stories

### Parallel Team Strategy (If Multiple Authors Available)

With multiple documentation authors:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phase 1-2) ‚Üí ~5-7 hours
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Author A (Priority)**: User Story 1 (P1) - Migration Guide ‚Üí ~10-12 hours
   - Wait for US1 complete before starting US2/US3 (US2 and US3 reference migration guide)
3. After US1 complete:
   - **Author A**: User Story 2 (P2) - README ‚Üí ~6-8 hours
   - **Author B**: User Story 3 (P2) - Configuration Guide ‚Üí ~8-10 hours
   - (US2 and US3 run in parallel)
4. After US2 and US3 complete:
   - **Author A**: User Story 4 (P3) - API Reference ‚Üí ~6-8 hours
   - **Author B**: User Story 5 (P3) - Architecture Docs ‚Üí ~6-8 hours
   - (US4 and US5 run in parallel)
5. Team performs Polish together (Phase 8) ‚Üí ~4-6 hours

**Total Duration with 2 Authors**: ~35-45 hours (wall-clock time with parallelization)

## Notes

### Documentation-Specific Guidance

- **[P] tasks**: Different files or sections, can be authored in parallel without conflicts
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability to spec.md requirements
- **Manual validation**: All validation is manual (FR-032, FR-033). Automated testing deferred to Phase 07.
- **Validation BEFORE implementation**: Review quickstart.md validation procedures before authoring to understand success criteria
- **No code changes**: Phase 05 is documentation-only. No source code modifications permitted.

### File Organization

- **5 documentation artifacts**: README.md (US2), docs/migration/v1-to-v2-migration.md (US1), docs/configuration/production-config.md (US3), docs/architecture/multi-project-design.md (US5), docs/api/tool-reference.md (US4)
- **Shared resources**: docs/glossary.md (FR-034), markdown style guide (FR-035)
- **Validation deliverables**: Link inventory spreadsheet (FR-032), code example test log (FR-033), consistency check report

### Success Criteria Alignment

- **SC-001**: 100% tool names match (2 tools) - validated in T039, T067, T089
- **SC-002**: 100% removed tools documented (14 tools) - validated in T025, T068, T090
- **SC-003**: 0 broken links - validated in T081, T084, T091
- **SC-004**: 100% code examples tested - validated in T082, T085, T092
- **SC-005**: 100% breaking changes mapped - validated in T093
- **SC-006**: 100% env vars documented - validated in T055, T094

### Quality Assurance

- **Master validation checklist**: quickstart.md contains 5 comprehensive test scenarios
- **Peer review required**: Separate reviewer validates 20% of links/examples and runs full migration test
- **Constitutional compliance**: Simplicity Over Features (documentation-only scope), Local-First Architecture (documents local system), Production Quality (comprehensive migration and configuration docs)

### Commit Strategy

- Commit after each user story phase completion (US1 ‚Üí commit, US2 ‚Üí commit, etc.)
- Include validation deliverables in commits (link inventory, test log)
- Use Conventional Commits format: `docs(US1): write migration guide breaking changes section`
- Final commit includes all artifacts and validation reports before PR submission

### Avoid

- Vague tasks (all tasks have specific file paths and section names)
- Cross-story dependencies that break independence (each user story is independently testable)
- Automated testing (explicitly deferred to Phase 07 per FR-032/FR-033)
- Code changes (Phase 05 is documentation-only per Non-Goals)
- Placeholder text (no "TODO", "[FILL IN]", etc. in final documentation)
