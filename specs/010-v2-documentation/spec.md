# Feature: Documentation Overhaul & Migration Guide for v2.0 Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `010-v2-documentation`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docs/mcp-split-plan/phases/phase-05-docs-migration/specify-prompt-enhanced.md"

## Original User Description

After completing the codebase-mcp refactoring from 16 tools to 2 tools with multi-project support, all documentation must be updated to reflect the new architecture. Users upgrading from v1.x need clear migration instructions explaining breaking changes, step-by-step upgrade procedures, and rollback options. New users need accurate documentation showing the simplified 2-tool API with multi-project capabilities. All references to the 14 removed tools must be eliminated, and the new connection pooling architecture must be explained.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Existing User Upgrades from v1.x (Priority: P1)

An existing codebase-mcp v1.x user discovers the v2.0 release and needs to upgrade their production system while minimizing risk and downtime. They need clear guidance on breaking changes, step-by-step procedures, data preservation, and rollback options.

**Why this priority**: This is P1 because existing users face breaking changes that could cause production issues without clear migration guidance. Poor upgrade documentation leads to support tickets, failed deployments, and user frustration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following migration guide with a v1.x installation and verifying successful upgrade to v2.0 with indexed code repositories preserved and v2.0 functionality working. Delivers value by enabling safe production upgrades.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is running codebase-mcp v1.x, **When** they read README.md, **Then** breaking changes are clearly indicated with link to migration guide
2. **Given** user opens migration guide, **When** they view first section, **Then** all breaking changes are summarized upfront before procedures
3. **Given** user reviews breaking changes, **When** they see removed tools section, **Then** all 14 removed tools are listed by name with descriptions
4. **Given** user prepares for upgrade, **When** they follow backup procedures, **Then** exact commands for database and configuration backup are provided
5. **Given** user executes upgrade steps, **When** they run migration script, **Then** clear execution instructions and expected outputs are documented
6. **Given** user completes upgrade, **When** they run verification commands, **Then** guide provides tests to confirm v2.0 functionality works
7. **Given** upgrade fails or user needs to revert, **When** they follow rollback procedure, **Then** complete restoration to v1.x with v1.x functionality and data intact is achieved
8. **Given** user validates rollback, **When** they run validation commands, **Then** guide confirms v1.x restoration successful

---

### User Story 2 - New User First-Time Installation (Priority: P2)

A developer discovering codebase-mcp for the first time needs to understand what it does, install it correctly, and perform their first indexing and search operations successfully within 15 minutes.

**Why this priority**: This is P2 because new user adoption drives ecosystem growth. Accurate, easy-to-follow documentation accelerates onboarding and builds user confidence in the project.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following README installation and quick-start sections with no prior codebase-mcp installation, completing first index and search successfully. Delivers value through rapid onboarding.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user discovers codebase-mcp repository, **When** they read README overview, **Then** clear description of 2 tools and multi-project support is presented
2. **Given** user reviews requirements, **When** they check installation section, **Then** PostgreSQL version, Python version, and dependencies are listed clearly
3. **Given** user installs codebase-mcp, **When** they execute installation commands, **Then** pip install command and verification steps work correctly
4. **Given** user performs first indexing, **When** they follow example command, **Then** default project behavior is explained and example works
5. **Given** user performs first search, **When** they execute search command, **Then** result format and interpretation guidance is provided
6. **Given** user wants multiple projects, **When** they follow multi-project example, **Then** project_id usage pattern is demonstrated clearly

---

### User Story 3 - Administrator Configures Production Deployment (Priority: P2)

A system administrator preparing a production deployment needs comprehensive configuration guidance to optimize PostgreSQL settings, tune connection pools correctly, and validate the deployment configuration before going live.

**Why this priority**: This is P2 because misconfigured production deployments lead to performance issues, connection exhaustion, and production incidents. Proper configuration documentation prevents these problems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following configuration guide to deploy codebase-mcp in staging environment with correct PostgreSQL tuning and connection pool settings validated. Delivers value through optimal production deployments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** administrator prepares production deployment, **When** they review configuration guide, **Then** comprehensive environment variable reference table is provided
2. **Given** administrator reviews PostgreSQL requirements, **When** they check connection calculation, **Then** max_connections formula is documented with examples
3. **Given** administrator tunes connection pools, **When** they review MAX_PROJECTS setting, **Then** tradeoffs and PostgreSQL impact are explained clearly
4. **Given** administrator tunes connection pools, **When** they review MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_POOL, **Then** recommended values for different scenarios are provided
5. **Given** administrator configures monitoring, **When** they review monitoring guidance, **Then** connection pool metrics and health indicators are documented
6. **Given** administrator validates configuration, **When** they use validation checklist, **Then** all critical settings have validation commands

---

### User Story 4 - Developer Integrates workflow-mcp (Priority: P3)

A developer building on top of codebase-mcp wants to integrate workflow-mcp for automatic project detection. They need architecture diagrams, integration examples, and fallback behavior documentation.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because workflow-mcp integration is optional and serves advanced use cases. Integration examples enable ecosystem development but are not required for basic usage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following integration documentation to configure workflow-mcp connection and verify automatic project detection works. Delivers value through simplified multi-project workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer wants automatic project detection, **When** they read README integration section, **Then** workflow-mcp integration is clearly marked optional
2. **Given** developer reviews integration architecture, **When** they view architecture diagram, **Then** integration points and data flow are visualized
3. **Given** developer configures workflow-mcp, **When** they set environment variables, **Then** WORKFLOW_MCP_URL and timeout settings are documented
4. **Given** developer tests integration, **When** they use automatic project detection, **Then** example shows project_id automatically resolved
5. **Given** workflow-mcp is unavailable, **When** integration times out, **Then** fallback behavior to default project is documented

---

### User Story 5 - Maintainer Contributes to Project (Priority: P3)

A new contributor wants to understand the codebase architecture, set up a development environment, and contribute documentation improvements or code changes confidently.

**Why this priority**: This is P3 because maintainer documentation supports long-term sustainability but doesn't block user adoption. Good architecture documentation reduces contributor onboarding time.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by following contributor documentation to set up development environment and understand architecture well enough to make meaningful contributions. Delivers value through sustainable project maintenance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** maintainer reviews architecture documentation, **When** they study multi-project design, **Then** connection pool manager and database-per-project strategy are explained
2. **Given** maintainer studies database design, **When** they check naming conventions, **Then** database naming pattern with examples is documented
3. **Given** maintainer understands connection pools, **When** they review pool lifecycle, **Then** LRU eviction and MAX_PROJECTS enforcement are explained
4. **Given** maintainer wants to contribute, **When** they follow development setup, **Then** environment setup and testing procedures are provided

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a new user with no previous codebase-mcp installation reads documentation?** - README provides complete setup from scratch with no mention of migration, ensuring clean onboarding experience
- **What happens when a v2.0 user accidentally follows v1.x documentation?** - Commands fail with clear error messages indicating version mismatch and linking to correct documentation
- **What happens when migration script fails midway through upgrade?** - Migration guide explains how to diagnose failure, provides resume instructions if possible, and documents complete rollback procedure
- **What happens when administrator sets MAX_PROJECTS=20 but PostgreSQL max_connections=100?** - Configuration guide provides calculation formula (20 pools Ã— 20 connections = 400 needed) and warns about insufficient connections
- **What happens when user searches for "upgrade" or "migration" in documentation?** - README prominently links to migration guide in breaking changes section with multiple entry points
- **What happens when v1.x user looks for removed tool (e.g., create_work_item) in API docs?** - API reference clearly states "Removed in v2.0 - see migration guide" with link to explanation
- **What happens when user upgrades without adding new environment variables?** - Server uses documented default values, configuration guide lists all variables with defaults
- **What happens when user searches PostgreSQL for "codebase_mcp" database after indexing project "my-app"?** - Architecture documentation explains database-per-project naming convention: codebase_my-app
- **What happens when workflow-mcp integration is configured but workflow-mcp is unavailable?** - README documents fallback to default project with clear error message and timeout behavior
- **What happens when user executes rollback but is unsure if it succeeded?** - Migration guide provides validation commands to verify v1.x restoration and troubleshooting section for partial rollback

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: During v1.x to v2.0 migration, what happens to existing data (work items, entities, deployments, entity types)? Is all v1.x project-scoped data discarded, or is there a migration path for some/all data? â†’ A: All v1.x project-scoped data is discarded; only indexed code repositories are preserved in v2.0
- Q: Should Phase 05 include actual testing with various database sizes to produce migration duration estimates, or can we provide generic guidance? â†’ A: Defer duration estimates entirely to Phase 06 performance testing; migration guide omits timing guidance
- Q: Should Phase 05 deliver automation scripts/CI integration for link checking and example testing, or is manual validation sufficient? â†’ A: Defer all testing tooling to Phase 07 deployment automation; Phase 05 focuses purely on content
