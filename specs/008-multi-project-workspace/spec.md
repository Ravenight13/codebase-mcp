# Feature: Multi-Project Workspace Support

**Feature Branch**: `008-multi-project-workspace`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Multi-project workspace support for isolated codebase management

## Original User Description

Users working on multiple codebases need to keep them isolated - searching one project should never return results from another project. Currently, the codebase-mcp server can only index and search a single codebase. Users need the ability to maintain multiple projects simultaneously without data contamination or complex manual database management.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A full-stack developer maintains separate codebases for frontend, backend, and shared libraries. When searching for authentication logic, they need to find only results relevant to their currently active project without manually managing separate database instances or complex configuration files. The system automatically isolates each project's indexed code and search results, ensuring zero cross-contamination.

### Primary Workflow: Multi-Project Development

**Step-by-step user journey:**

1. Developer starts work on client-a project
2. System provides isolated workspace for client-a
3. Developer indexes client-a codebase
4. System stores client-a code in isolated workspace
5. Developer searches for "authentication logic" in client-a
6. System returns only client-a results, zero cross-contamination
7. Developer switches to client-b project
8. System switches to client-b isolated workspace
9. Developer searches for "authentication logic" in client-b
10. System returns only client-b results, different from client-a
11. Developer verifies no cross-contamination between projects
12. System confirms complete isolation via testing

### Alternative Path: Workflow Automation Integration

**Automatic project detection:**

**IF** workflow-mcp is available:
1. Developer does not specify project identifier
2. System queries workflow-mcp for active project
3. System uses active project context automatically
4. Developer continues without manual project specification

**ELSE**:
1. System uses default project workspace
2. Developer continues with backward-compatible behavior

### Alternative Path: New Project Creation

**First-time project setup:**

1. Developer specifies new project identifier for first time
2. System detects project workspace does not exist
3. System validates appropriate permissions exist
4. System creates isolated workspace automatically
5. Developer indexes first repository into new project
6. System confirms workspace ready for use

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** developer is working on project-a and has indexed its codebase, **When** developer searches for "authentication", **Then** system returns only results from project-a with zero results from other projects

2. **Given** developer switches from project-a to project-b, **When** developer performs the same search query, **Then** system returns completely different results specific to project-b

3. **Given** developer provides a new project identifier "client-xyz", **When** system detects no existing workspace for this identifier, **Then** system automatically creates isolated workspace without manual intervention

4. **Given** workflow-mcp integration is available, **When** developer performs indexing or search without specifying project, **Then** system automatically uses active project from workflow-mcp

5. **Given** workflow-mcp integration times out, **When** system detects timeout condition, **Then** system falls back to default workspace and logs timeout event

6. **Given** developer provides invalid project identifier "My_Project", **When** system validates the identifier, **Then** system rejects with clear message about lowercase alphanumeric with hyphen format

### Edge Cases

#### Empty State - No Projects Yet
- **What happens when**: First-time user with no existing projects
- **System behavior**: Uses default project workspace automatically
- **User experience**: Immediate productivity without setup, can create additional projects later

#### Boundary Condition - Maximum Project Identifier Length
- **What happens when**: Developer provides 50-character project identifier (maximum allowed)
- **System behavior**: Accepts and creates workspace successfully
- **User experience**: Valid input processed normally

#### Boundary Condition - Exceeds Maximum Length
- **What happens when**: Developer provides 51+ character project identifier
- **System behavior**: Rejects with clear message: "Project identifier must be 50 characters or less"
- **User experience**: Developer shortens identifier and retries successfully

#### Error Scenario - Invalid Characters in Identifier
- **What happens when**: Developer provides "My_Project" (uppercase and underscore)
- **System behavior**: Rejects with message: "Project identifiers must be lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens only"
- **User experience**: Developer corrects to "my-project" format and succeeds

#### Error Scenario - Permission Denied
- **What happens when**: System lacks permission to create new project workspace
- **System behavior**: Displays error: "Cannot create project workspace - insufficient permissions. Contact administrator."
- **User experience**: Developer escalates to administrator, who grants permissions, then developer retries successfully

#### Error Scenario - Workflow Integration Timeout
- **What happens when**: workflow-mcp query exceeds timeout threshold
- **System behavior**: Logs timeout, falls back to default project workspace
- **User experience**: Developer continues with default workspace, can manually specify project if needed

#### Error Scenario - Workflow Integration Unavailable
- **What happens when**: workflow-mcp server not accessible
- **System behavior**: Detects unavailability, falls back to default project workspace
- **User experience**: Developer continues with default workspace or manual specification

#### Concurrent Operation - Simultaneous Project Creation
- **What happens when**: Two developers create same project identifier simultaneously
- **System behavior**: Handles race condition gracefully (first succeeds, second reuses existing workspace)
- **User experience**: Both developers use same project workspace (intended behavior for collaboration)

#### Security Scenario - SQL Injection Attempt
- **What happens when**: Developer provides malicious project identifier: `"project'; DROP TABLE--"`
- **System behavior**: Validation rejects before any database operations occur
- **User experience**: System logs security event, developer must use valid identifier

### Key Entities

#### Entity: Project Workspace

- **Purpose**: Represents an isolated environment for a single codebase or logical project grouping
- **Lifecycle**:
  - Created: Automatically on first use of a new project identifier
  - Updated: Implicitly when repositories indexed or searches performed
  - Deleted: Future feature - workspace deletion requires explicit confirmation flag
- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Identifier**: Unique string identifying the workspace (lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens, max 50 chars)
  - **Isolation Boundary**: Workspace stores all indexed repositories and search indices independently
  - **Creation Timestamp**: When workspace first created (for future archival features)
- **Business Invariants**:
  - Identifier must remain immutable after creation (no renaming)
  - Complete isolation guarantee: no data sharing between workspaces
  - Default workspace always available for backward compatibility

#### Entity: Project Identifier

- **Purpose**: Validated string that uniquely names a project workspace
- **Lifecycle**:
  - Created: User provides identifier in indexing or search operation
  - Updated: Never (immutable)
  - Deleted: N/A (identifiers persist with workspaces)
- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Format**: Lowercase alphanumeric characters with hyphens only
  - **Length**: 1-50 characters inclusive
  - **Constraints**: Cannot start/end with hyphen, no consecutive hyphens
- **Business Invariants**:
  - Must pass validation before any operations
  - Same identifier always resolves to same workspace
  - Validation prevents security vulnerabilities

#### Entity: Workflow Integration Context (Optional)

- **Purpose**: Represents active project context from workflow-mcp when available
- **Lifecycle**:
  - Created: Queried from workflow-mcp on demand
  - Updated: Cached temporarily (recommended 1 minute)
  - Deleted: Cache expires after TTL
- **Key Attributes**:
  - **Active Project**: Current project identifier from workflow-mcp
  - **Cache Timestamp**: When value retrieved (for expiration calculation)
  - **Status**: Success, unavailable, timeout, invalid response
- **Business Invariants**:
  - Graceful degradation required (system works without workflow-mcp)
  - Cache must not serve stale values beyond TTL
  - Errors must not block user operations
