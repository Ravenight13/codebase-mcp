# Specification Quality Checklist: Production-Grade Connection Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Branch**: `009-v2-connection-mgmt`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS ✓

**Analysis**:
- Specification describes WHAT (connection pooling, health monitoring) and WHY (reliability, observability) without HOW
- No mention of specific Python classes, asyncpg implementation details, or code structure
- Language is accessible: "system administrator," "developer," "connection pool" are general terms
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness: PASS ✓

**Analysis**:
- **No clarification markers**: All requirements are fully specified with concrete values (e.g., "2 seconds," "exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s")
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR has specific acceptance criteria (e.g., FR-001: "completes within 2 seconds or logging detailed error")
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC items include quantitative metrics (SC-001: "<2 seconds p95," SC-002: "<10ms p95")
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe outcomes from user perspective (e.g., "Pool initialization completes" not "asyncpg.create_pool() succeeds")
- **Comprehensive acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3-5 Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy path and variations
- **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented with expected behavior
- **Scope bounded**: Focus on single-database connection management, no multi-tenancy or read replicas
- **Dependencies clear**: Foundation for Phase-05 (Repository Indexing) and Phase-06 (Semantic Search)

### Feature Readiness: PASS ✓

**Analysis**:
- **FR acceptance criteria**: All 10 functional requirements have specific, measurable acceptance criteria
  - Example: FR-002 includes "completing in under 5ms, and creating new connection if validation fails"
- **User scenario coverage**: 4 prioritized user stories cover critical flows (P1: startup, outage recovery; P2: observability; P3: leak detection)
- **Success criteria alignment**: 10 measurable outcomes map directly to functional requirements
  - FR-001 (pool initialization) → SC-001 (initialization <2s p95)
  - FR-002 (connection validation) → SC-002 (acquisition <10ms p95)
  - FR-004 (statistics) → SC-007 (real-time updates <1ms staleness)
- **No implementation leakage**: Entities section describes responsibilities and behaviors, not Python classes or methods

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: Excellent

This specification demonstrates best practices:
1. **Clear prioritization**: User stories ranked P1-P3 with justification for each priority level
2. **Independent testability**: Each user story can be tested independently (e.g., P3 leak detection can be tested without implementing P2 statistics)
3. **Comprehensive edge cases**: 8 edge cases with detailed expected behavior
4. **Measurable outcomes**: All success criteria include quantitative metrics (latency percentiles, operation counts, time bounds)
5. **Technology-agnostic language**: Describes connection pooling concepts without mentioning asyncpg, Python, or specific implementation patterns

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` without requiring `/speckit.clarify`.

**Assumptions documented in spec**:
- Single database deployment (no multi-tenancy)
- PostgreSQL 14+ compatibility assumed
- MCP protocol non-blocking requirement (no stdout/stderr pollution)
- Fail-fast on startup failures (don't enter degraded state with invalid config)
