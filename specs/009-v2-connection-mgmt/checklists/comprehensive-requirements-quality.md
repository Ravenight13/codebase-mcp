**Traceability Coverage**: 147/175 items (84%) include explicit spec section references, [Gap] markers, or cross-references

**Risk Coverage**:
- Connection leak detection: CHK006, CHK072, CHK080, CHK099, CHK106, CHK151
- Database outage recovery: CHK003, CHK013, CHK066, CHK069, CHK076-CHK078, CHK081, CHK083, CHK100-CHK101, CHK103

- Configuration errors: CHK007, CHK026, CHK028, CHK070, CHK106-CHK115, CHK137-CHK145

**Quality Dimensions Addressed**:
- ✅ Completeness (all necessary requirements present)
- ✅ Clarity (requirements specific and unambiguous)
- ✅ Consistency (requirements align without conflicts)
- ✅ Measurability (success criteria objectively verifiable)
- ✅ Coverage (all scenarios/edge cases addressed)
- ✅ Traceability (requirements linked to user stories and tests)

**Notes**:
- This checklist is "unit tests for requirements writing" - each item evaluates the quality of the requirements themselves, not implementation correctness
- Items marked [Gap] indicate potentially missing requirements that should be considered
- Items marked [Ambiguity] or [Conflict] indicate requirements needing clarification
- All items can be checked during spec review before implementation begins
