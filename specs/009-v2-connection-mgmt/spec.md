# Feature Specification: Production-Grade Connection Management

**Feature Branch**: `009-v2-connection-mgmt`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase 04: Connection Management - Implement connection pooling, lifecycle management, and health monitoring for MCP server connections"

## Original User Description

"Phase 04: Connection Management - Implement connection pooling, lifecycle management, and health monitoring for MCP server connections"

The connection management system must handle:
- Connection pool lifecycle (initialization, health checks, graceful shutdown)
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection validation and health monitoring
- Pool statistics and metrics for observability
- Resource cleanup and leak prevention
- Configuration validation and defaults

This is a foundational infrastructure component that Phase-05 (Repository Indexing) and Phase-06 (Semantic Search) will directly depend on.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary Workflow

**Normal Operation Sequence**:

1. **System Administrator** configures DATABASE_URL environment variable with PostgreSQL connection string
2. **Developer** starts MCP server via command line
3. **System** initializes connection pool with min_size connections within 2 seconds
4. **System** validates all connections via lightweight health query
5. **System** transitions to "healthy" state, ready to accept MCP requests
6. **MCP Client** sends database query request (e.g., search_code, index_repository)
7. **System** acquires connection from pool (or creates new connection up to max_size)
8. **System** executes query on borrowed connection
9. **System** releases connection back to pool for reuse
10. **System Administrator** monitors pool statistics via health check endpoint
11. **System Administrator** triggers graceful shutdown when maintenance needed
12. **System** waits for active queries to complete (up to 30s timeout), then terminates

---

### User Story 1 - Server Startup with Valid Configuration (Priority: P1)

As a developer, when I start the MCP server with a valid database configuration, I expect the connection pool to initialize successfully and be ready to handle requests within 2 seconds.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical functionality - without successful pool initialization, no database operations can occur. This is the foundation for all other connection management features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting the MCP server with valid DATABASE_URL and observing initialization logs. Delivers immediate value by ensuring the server can connect to the database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://localhost/codebase_mcp is set, **When** server starts with `python -m codebase_mcp.server`, **Then** server logs show "Connection pool initialized: min_size=2, max_size=10" within 2 seconds
2. **Given** connection pool is initialized, **When** health check endpoint is queried, **Then** response shows status "healthy" with connections {"total": 2, "idle": 2, "active": 0}
3. **Given** pool is initialized, **When** first database query is executed, **Then** query completes in under 100ms with no cold start delay
4. **Given** pool initialization is attempted, **When** all connections pass validation queries (SELECT 1), **Then** server becomes ready for MCP requests

---

### User Story 2 - Graceful Handling of Database Outage (Priority: P1)

As a system administrator, when the database server becomes unavailable during operation, I expect the MCP server to attempt automatic reconnection without crashing, and resume operations when the database recovers.

**Why this priority**: Resilience to database outages is critical for production systems. Without automatic reconnection, every temporary network issue would require manual server restart.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by stopping PostgreSQL during operation and observing automatic recovery behavior. Delivers value by maintaining service availability during transient failures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** MCP server is running with active pool, **When** query executes successfully (search_code), **Then** results are returned within expected time
2. **Given** server is operational, **When** PostgreSQL is stopped, **Then** subsequent queries return DATABASE_ERROR without server crash
3. **Given** database is unavailable, **When** server attempts reconnection, **Then** logs show exponential backoff attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
4. **Given** reconnection attempts are in progress, **When** PostgreSQL restarts, **Then** pool automatically recovers and logs "Connection pool recovered: 2/10 connections available"
5. **Given** pool has recovered, **When** queries are retried, **Then** operations succeed and return expected results

---

### User Story 3 - Pool Statistics and Observability (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator monitoring production systems, I need to query connection pool statistics to understand database load and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production operations and capacity planning, but system can function without detailed statistics. Enables proactive monitoring before issues occur.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by querying pool statistics API during various load conditions. Delivers value by providing visibility into system performance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** server just started, **When** statistics are queried, **Then** response shows total_connections=2, idle=2, active=0, total_acquisitions=0
2. **Given** 5 concurrent queries are executing, **When** statistics are queried during execution, **Then** response shows total_connections=5, active=5, idle=0, waiting_requests=0
3. **Given** queries have completed, **When** statistics are queried again, **Then** response shows total_acquisitions=5, total_releases=5, avg_acquisition_time_ms is recorded
4. **Given** pool has been idle for 60 seconds, **When** statistics are queried, **Then** pool has shrunk back to min_size=2 connections
5. **Given** pool is under load, **When** health check endpoint is called, **Then** real-time metrics are returned without stale data

---

### User Story 4 - Connection Leak Detection and Prevention (Priority: P3)

As a developer, if my code accidentally holds database connections without releasing them, I expect the connection pool to detect this and log warnings to help me identify the leak.

**Why this priority**: Important for debugging and preventing resource exhaustion, but not critical for basic functionality. System can operate without leak detection, though it helps prevent issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a connection held beyond timeout and verifying warning logs appear. Delivers value by helping developers identify problematic code patterns.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** pool configured with max_size=5 and leak_detection_timeout=30s, **When** 3 queries complete normally, **Then** pool shows idle=5, active=0
2. **Given** leak_detection_timeout=30s, **When** connection is held for 40 seconds without being released, **Then** server logs "WARNING: Potential connection leak detected. Connection held for 30s" with stack trace
3. **Given** leak warning was logged, **When** connection is eventually returned to pool, **Then** pool returns to normal state (idle=5, active=0)
4. **Given** long-running legitimate operation, **When** operation exceeds timeout, **Then** no false positives occur (timeout can be configured per-operation)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when database server restarts during active queries? → Active queries fail with ConnectionResetError, pool detects failure, closes all connections, triggers automatic reconnection, returns to healthy state
- How does system handle connection exhaustion under high load? → Requests exceeding max_size queue in FIFO order, waiting_requests counter increments, timeout error raised after 30s with pool statistics
- What happens when min_size cannot be achieved during initialization? → Server startup fails after 3 retry attempts with detailed error message (fail-fast approach)
- How does system handle partial database connectivity? → Pool operates in degraded mode with reduced capacity, health status shows "degraded", continues attempting to create additional connections
- What happens when configuration conflicts exist (min_size > max_size)? → Configuration validation fails before pool creation, ValueError raised with actionable suggestions, server fails to start
- How does system handle long-running queries (>30 seconds)? → Connection remains active during query, leak detection warning logged (if enabled), query completes successfully, connection returned to pool
- What happens during graceful shutdown with active queries? → Pool status changes to shutting_down, new requests rejected, waits up to 30s for active connections, force-closes remaining connections with warnings
- How does system handle connections that never return to pool? → Connection eventually recycled after max_connection_lifetime (1 hour)

### Alternative Paths

**IF** database connectivity lost during operation:
1. Active queries fail with connection errors
2. System enters reconnection mode with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
3. New requests return DATABASE_ERROR until recovery
4. **WHEN** database recovers → pool automatically reconnects
5. System resumes normal operation without restart

**IF** connection acquisition exceeds max_size:
1. Requests queue in FIFO order
2. waiting_requests counter increments
3. **WHEN** connection available → first queued request acquires it
4. **WHEN** timeout (30s) exceeded → request fails with PoolTimeoutError

**IF** connection held longer than leak_detection_timeout:
1. System logs warning with connection details and stack trace
2. Connection remains active (no forced termination)
3. **WHEN** connection eventually released → normal operation resumes
4. Leak detection helps identify problematic code patterns

**IF** graceful shutdown initiated with active queries:
1. Pool status transitions to shutting_down
2. New connection requests rejected
3. System waits up to 30s for active connections to complete
4. **WHEN** timeout exceeded → force-close remaining connections with warnings
5. All resources released, shutdown completes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### User Types & Permissions

**Note**: Connection management is infrastructure-level functionality without user-facing authentication. All users mentioned in scenarios are operators of the MCP server process, not end-users of the system.

- **System Administrator**: Operator with OS-level permissions to start/stop MCP server process, access server logs, and configure environment variables. Can monitor pool statistics and trigger graceful shutdown.

- **Developer**: Operator running MCP server in development environment with access to configuration files, debug output, and local database. Can modify pool configuration and observe connection behavior.

- **MCP Client**: External process or application communicating via MCP protocol. Treated as authenticated by virtue of server accepting the connection. No direct access to connection pool internals.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ConnectionPoolManager**: Top-level manager responsible for connection pool lifecycle (initialization, health monitoring, graceful shutdown), exposes pool statistics, coordinates reconnection attempts, tracks lifecycle states (initializing, healthy, degraded, unhealthy, recovering, shutting_down, terminated)
- **ConnectionPool**: Connection pool abstraction that manages database connection lifecycle, acquiring and releasing connections on demand, validating connections before use, and tracking connection metrics
- **PoolStatistics**: Immutable snapshot of connection pool state containing real-time metrics (total_connections, idle_connections, active_connections, waiting_requests, total_acquisitions, total_releases, avg_acquisition_time_ms) and historical peaks (peak_active_connections, peak_wait_time_ms) for monitoring and capacity planning
- **PoolConfig**: Configuration structure containing pool parameters (min_size, max_size, max_queries, max_idle_time, timeout, command_timeout, max_connection_lifetime, leak_detection_timeout, enable_leak_detection) with validation rules and environment variable support
- **HealthStatus**: Health check response object containing status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy), timestamp, database connectivity information, pool statistics, latency metrics, and last error details

### Assumptions

- **Single database instance**: System connects to one PostgreSQL database per MCP server instance. Multi-database scenarios require multiple server instances or separate connection pools.

- **PostgreSQL-compatible protocol**: Connection pool is designed for PostgreSQL wire protocol. Other databases (MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB) are not supported.

- **Unix-like signal handling**: Graceful shutdown relies on SIGTERM/SIGINT signals. Windows service stop commands may require adaptation.

- **Async runtime available**: Connection pool assumes async/await execution model. Synchronous blocking execution contexts are not supported.

- **Database schema pre-initialized**: Connection pool assumes database and schema already exist. Schema migrations and database creation are handled separately.

- **Network reliability**: Exponential backoff assumes transient network failures. Permanent network partitions may require operator intervention.

- **Single server instance**: Connection pool statistics are per-server-instance. Multi-instance deployments require aggregation at load balancer or monitoring layer.

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

### Cloud-Based Connection Pooling
This feature focuses on local PostgreSQL connection management. Cloud-specific connection poolers (AWS RDS Proxy, Azure Connection Pooler, Google Cloud SQL Proxy) are out of scope.

### Distributed Transaction Coordination
Connection pool manages single-database connections. Multi-database transactions, two-phase commit, or distributed transaction coordinators (XA transactions) are not included.

### Read Replica Load Balancing
Connection pool assumes single primary database endpoint. Automatic routing of read queries to read replicas or write queries to primary is deferred to future phases.

### Connection Multiplexing/Session Pooling
Feature implements connection-level pooling where each client request uses a dedicated connection. Session-level multiplexing (PgBouncer-style transaction pooling) is out of scope.

### Advanced Monitoring Dashboards
Feature exposes pool statistics via API and health check endpoint. Grafana dashboards, Prometheus exporters, and visualization tools are deferred to future observability features.

### Connection Encryption Management
Feature assumes DATABASE_URL includes appropriate SSL/TLS settings. Certificate rotation, encryption negotiation, and SSL configuration management are handled by PostgreSQL client library, not by the pool.

### Geographic Load Balancing
Connection pool connects to single database endpoint. Multi-region database deployments, geographic failover, and latency-based routing are not included.
