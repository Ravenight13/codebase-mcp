# Tasks: Remove Non-Search MCP Tools

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-remove-non-search/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Execution Overview

This feature removes 14 non-search MCP tools through 4 atomic sub-phases with comprehensive final validation. Unlike typical features, this is a **deletion workflow** with intermediate breakage tolerance. Validation occurs only at baseline (before) and final state (after).

**Key Principles**:
- 4 atomic commits, one per sub-phase
- Intermediate breakage acceptable (clarification #1)
- Comprehensive validation only at final state (clarification #3, #5)
- Delete code exclusively used by non-search tools (clarification #2)

**Expected Outcome**: 16 → 2 MCP tools, ~60% code reduction, all search functionality preserved

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[DELETE]**: File deletion task
- **[UPDATE]**: File modification task
- **[VALIDATE]**: Test execution or verification task
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 3.5: Sub-Phase 4 - Delete Tests and Final Validation

**Purpose**: Complete deletion and verify comprehensive success criteria

**✅ NO intermediate breakage - all validations must pass**

**Integration Tests to PRESERVE** (not deleted in this phase):
- `test_semantic_search.py` - Search functionality (used in T001, T080 baseline/validation)
- `test_repository_indexing.py` - Indexing functionality (used in T002, T081 baseline/validation)
- `test_ai_assistant_integration.py` - MCP protocol integration tests
- `test_migration_002_upgrade.py` - Phase 01 migration validation
- `test_migration_002_downgrade.py` - Phase 01 migration validation
- `test_migration_002_validation.py` - Phase 01 migration validation
- `test_migration_data_preservation.py` - Phase 01 data integrity
- `test_performance_validation.py` - Search performance benchmarks
- `test_incremental_updates.py` - Indexing incremental updates
- `test_file_deletion_retention.py` - Indexing file lifecycle

These tests validate search/indexing functionality and Phase 01 migration - they remain to ensure no regression.

**Parallel Execution Example** (40 test deletions):
```bash
# Option 1: Delete by pattern with xargs (8 parallel jobs)
find tests/integration -name "test_task*.py" -o -name "test_*work_item*.py" -o \
     -name "test_*vendor*.py" -o -name "test_deployment*.py" | xargs -P 8 rm

find tests/unit -name "test_base_task*.py" -o -name "test_task_*.py" -o \
     -name "test_hierarchical*.py" -o -name "test_locking*.py" -o \
     -name "test_vendor*.py" -o -name "test_status*.py" | xargs -P 8 rm

find tests/contract -name "test_*task*.py" -o -name "test_*work_item*.py" -o \
     -name "test_*vendor*.py" -o -name "test_deployment*.py" -o \
     -name "test_configuration*.py" | xargs -P 8 rm

find tests -maxdepth 1 -name "test_cache.py" -o -name "test_mcp_server.py" -o \
     -name "test_mcp_tools.py" -o -name "test_tool_handlers.py" -o \
     -name "test_minimal*.py" -o -name "ultra_minimal.py" | xargs -P 8 rm

# Option 2: Explicit file list with parallel deletion
cat > /tmp/delete_tests.txt <<'EOF'
tests/integration/test_task_lifecycle.py
tests/integration/test_list_tasks_optimization.py
[... all 40 files ...]
EOF
cat /tmp/delete_tests.txt | xargs -P 8 -I {} rm {}
```

Note: Parallel deletion is optional - sequential deletion (T038-T077) is safer for tracking.

## Dependencies Graph

```
BASELINE (Phase 3.1):
T001 (search tests baseline) → T002 (indexing tests baseline) → T003 (server verification)
                                                                      ↓
SUB-PHASE 1 (Phase 3.2):
T003 → T004,T005,T006,T007 (delete tool files) → T008 (update __init__) → T009 (commit)
                                                                              ↓
SUB-PHASE 2 (Phase 3.3):
T009 → T010 (import analysis) → T011-T031 [P] (delete 21 files) → T032 (commit)
                                                                      ↓

       → T081 (indexing tests) → T082 (server) → T083 (full suite) → T084 (commit)
```

### Critical Paths

1. **Baseline Path**: T001 → T002 → T003 (must pass before any deletions)
2. **Validation Path**: T078 → T079 → T080 → T081 → T082 → T083 (must pass before final commit)
3. **Commit Path**: T009 → T032 → T037 → T084 (4 atomic commits)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 3.3 (Sub-Phase 2)**:
- T011-T015 [P]: All 5 model deletions can run in parallel
- T016-T021 [P]: All 6 service deletions (including stubs) can run in parallel
- T022-T031 [P]: All 10 utility/stub/doc deletions can run in parallel

**Phase 3.5 (Sub-Phase 4)**:
- T038-T077 [P]: All 40 test deletions can run in parallel

**Example Parallel Task Execution**:
```bash
# Phase 3.3: Delete models in parallel
Task: "Delete Task model (src/models/task.py)"
Task: "Delete Task schemas (src/models/task_schemas.py)"
Task: "Delete Task relations (src/models/task_relations.py)"
Task: "Delete Tracking models (src/models/tracking.py)"
Task: "Delete Tracking models backup (src/models/tracking.py.backup)"

# Phase 3.3: Delete services in parallel
Task: "Delete TaskService (src/services/tasks.py)"
Task: "Delete WorkItemService (src/services/work_items.py)"
Task: "Delete VendorService (src/services/vendor.py)"
Task: "Delete DeploymentService (src/services/deployment.py)"
Task: "Delete HierarchyService (src/services/hierarchy.py)"
Task: "Delete HierarchyService stub (src/services/hierarchy.pyi)"
```

## Task Ordering Rules

1. **Baseline First**: T001-T003 establish working state (critical gate)
2. **Sequential Sub-Phases**: Follow spec ordering (tools → DB ops → registration → tests)
3. **Atomic Commits**: One commit per sub-phase (T009, T032, T037, T084)
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: All validation in final sub-phase (T078-T083)
5. **Parallel Within Sub-Phase**: T011-T031 [P] in Phase 3.3, T038-T077 [P] in Phase 3.5
6. **NO Parallelization Across Sub-Phases**: T009 blocks T010, T032 blocks T033, etc.

## Notes

### TDD Approach
- **NOT APPLICABLE**: This is a deletion feature, not a build feature
- No new code written, so no TDD cycle required
- Validation focuses on preserving existing search functionality

### Intermediate Breakage Strategy
- **Sub-Phase 1-3**: Import errors and test failures EXPECTED and ACCEPTABLE
- **Sub-Phase 4**: All validations MUST pass before final commit
- Per clarification #1: "Intermediate sub-phases can have broken imports; only final state must work"

### Import Analysis (T010)
- **Critical**: Verifies deletion safety before removing ANALYZE files
- Per data-model.md Section 3: ZERO imports expected in search code
- If imports found: STOP and re-evaluate deletion safety

### Commit Messages
- Follow Conventional Commits format: `chore(scope): description`
- Include "Intermediate breakage acceptable" for T009, T032, T037
- Include validation results in T084 commit message
- Reference #007-remove-non-search in all commits

**Commit Message Format**:
```
chore(scope): brief summary (max 50 chars)

Detailed description of changes made in this sub-phase.
Explain what was deleted and why.

Status/Validation:
- Item 1: ✅ Description
- Item 2: ✅ Description

Related: #007-remove-non-search Sub-Phase N
```

For intermediate sub-phases (1-3): Include "Intermediate breakage acceptable"
For final sub-phase (4): Include validation results and edge case checklist

### Rollback Strategy
- Each sub-phase is atomic (single commit)
- Rollback: `git revert <commit-hash>` for problematic sub-phase
- Full rollback: `git revert T084..T009` (revert all 4 commits)
