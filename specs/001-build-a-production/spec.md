# Feature Specification: Production-Grade MCP Server for Semantic Code Search

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-production`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a production-grade MCP server that indexes code repositories into PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search, designed specifically for AI coding assistants. The MCP should be able to ingest an existing codebase, create embeddings for the files and store them in the database. It should also be able to add/update as the code is developed. It should include a task reminder system that can be used to help during the development process where the developer can log tasks with notes and related planning files that need to be done, are in-progress, and complete with related branch and commit details."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What are the target performance requirements for repository indexing? → A: Medium repos (up to 10,000 files / 1M lines) indexed in under 60 seconds
- Q: What is the acceptable latency for semantic search queries? → A: Under 500ms (responsive, suitable for on-demand queries)
- Q: How should the system handle deleted files? → A: Mark as deleted, retain for 90 days (medium-term recovery)
- Q: What file ignore patterns should the system respect when scanning repositories? → A: .gitignore + custom .mcpignore file (flexible control)
- Q: Which programming languages and file types should the system index? → A: All text files (language-agnostic, detect by content)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.), I need to semantically search through a developer's codebase and track development tasks so that I can provide contextually accurate assistance, understand project progress, and help developers stay organized during the development process.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a code repository on the local filesystem, **When** the MCP server is configured to index the repository, **Then** all source files are scanned, semantic embeddings are generated and stored in the database with searchable metadata

2. **Given** an indexed codebase, **When** a developer modifies existing files or adds new files, **Then** the MCP server detects the changes and updates the embeddings without requiring full re-indexing

3. **Given** an AI assistant needs to find relevant code, **When** a semantic search query is submitted, **Then** the system returns the most relevant code snippets ranked by similarity with sufficient context for understanding

4. **Given** a developer working on a feature, **When** they create a task with description, notes, and planning file references, **Then** the task is stored with "need to be done" status and associated metadata

5. **Given** a developer starts working on a task, **When** they update the task status to "in-progress" with branch information, **Then** the task tracking system records the status change and branch association

6. **Given** a developer completes a task, **When** they mark it "complete" with commit details, **Then** the system stores the completion status, commit information, and maintains the full task history

7. **Given** multiple tasks exist in the system, **When** an AI assistant queries for project status or task context, **Then** accurate task information is returned including status, notes, related planning files, branch, and commit details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the codebase exceeds target size (>10,000 files or >1M lines)?
- How does the system handle binary files or non-text files?
- What happens when file encoding is ambiguous or corrupted?
- How are deleted files handled after the 90-day retention period expires?
- What happens when concurrent processes modify the same files?
- How does the system handle tasks without branch or commit information?
- What happens if planning file references in tasks point to non-existent files?
- How are task conflicts resolved when multiple users work on the same repository?

## Notes & Recommendations

This specification captures the core functionality needed for a production-grade MCP server focused on semantic code search and task tracking. The system will serve AI coding assistants by providing:

1. **Semantic Code Understanding**: Deep codebase indexing with vector embeddings enables AI assistants to find relevant code based on intent, not just keywords

2. **Incremental Intelligence**: Smart update detection ensures the index stays current as code evolves without expensive full re-indexing

3. **Development Context**: Task tracking with planning references, branch, and commit details gives AI assistants awareness of project progress and developer intent

4. **Production Readiness**: Requirements focus on reliability, performance, error handling, and graceful degradation

**Key Clarifications Needed** (15 items marked):
- Performance targets (index time, search latency, repository size limits)
- File handling policies (ignore patterns, supported languages, deletion behavior)
- Task management details (planning reference format, history granularity)
- Operational requirements (concurrency levels, backup strategy, monitoring integration)

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/clarify` to resolve ambiguities through targeted Q&A
2. Proceed to `/plan` for technical design and implementation planning
3. Use `/tasks` to generate detailed task breakdown
4. Execute with `/implement` using orchestrated subagent workflow

The specification is ready for the clarification phase.
