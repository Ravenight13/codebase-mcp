## Constitutional Traceability & Compliance

**Purpose**: Validate that all performance requirements trace to constitutional principles and compliance is verifiable.

- [ ] CHK001 - Is the traceability from each performance target to Constitutional Principle IV explicitly documented? [Traceability, Spec FR-001 through FR-020]

  **Status**: ✅ Confirmed - Consistent across all documents

- [x] CHK003 - Are baseline performance targets and degradation thresholds unambiguously defined with operational terminology? [Clarity, Constitution Principle IV]

  **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Added SC-015 through SC-018 (spec.md lines 201-204) covering Principles VI, VII, VIII, and X. Combined with existing SC-001 through SC-014, constitutional principles IV and V are now comprehensively validated. Remaining principles (I-III, IX, XI) are validated implicitly through specification-first workflow and orchestrated implementation.

- [ ] CHK005 - Does the hybrid regression detection logic (10% degradation + constitutional targets) have formal definition and rationale? [Clarity, Spec FR-018]
  **Status**: ✅ Confirmed - FR-018 + research.md §6 provide comprehensive definition

  **Status**: ✅ Confirmed - AND logic is consistent

- [ ] ~~CHK007~~ - REMOVED (Tests implementation consequences, not requirements quality)

- [ ] CHK008 - Is the precedence rule for conflicting thresholds (baseline vs constitutional) unambiguous? [Clarity, Research §6 lines 268-305]
  **Status**: ✅ Confirmed - Boolean AND logic makes precedence explicit

- [ ] CHK009 - Does the specification define how constitutional compliance validation results inform production deployment decisions? [Traceability, Success Criteria]

  **Status**: ✅ Confirmed - Explicitly quantified with rationale

- [ ] CHK018 - Are load testing parameters (ramp-up rate, duration, request pacing) specified as requirements? [Completeness, Quickstart §Scenario 4]
  **Status**: 🔧 ADJUSTED - Add to spec.md FR-007 or new FR: "Load testing MUST simulate gradual ramp-up from 0 to 50 clients over 5 minutes. Request pacing should reflect realistic user think time (minimum 1 second between requests per client)."

- [ ] CHK019 - Is "uptime" operationally defined (server running, health check responding, or request success rate)? [Clarity, Spec SC-007]
  **Status**: 🔧 ADJUSTED - Clarify SC-007: "Uptime is defined as successful request completion rate (failed requests <0.1% during 1-hour load test period)."

- [ ] CHK020 - Are resource utilization measurement requirements and thresholds specified? [Gap, Data Model §LoadTestResult]
  **Status**: 🔧 ADJUSTED - Add to spec.md: "Resource utilization metrics MUST include CPU percentage, memory usage (MB), and connection pool utilization percentage. No specific thresholds required - metrics serve observability purpose only."

  **Status**: 📝 DOCUMENTED - Added to Known Limitations (spec.md lines 256-264). FR→US traceability is implicit through document structure and thematic grouping.

  **Status**: 🔧 ADJUSTED - No glossary; assumes technical audience

- [ ] CHK113 - Are referenced external documents accessible and versioned? Constitution.md is at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, but pre-split baseline JSON files (docs/performance/baseline-pre-split.json) may not exist yet per spec §Assumptions line 178 - tasks T018 provides fallback [Dependency]
  **Status**: 🔧 ADJUSTED - Baseline files may not exist

- [ ] CHK114 - Is the relationship between spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, tasks.md documented? [Clarity, Workflow]
  **Status**: ✅ Confirmed - Explicitly documented

- [ ] CHK115 - Are the 10 edge cases enumerated in spec §Edge Cases (lines 111-123) mapped to specific test scenarios in tasks.md? [Coverage, Traceability]
  **Status**: ➕ NEW - Some edge cases lack task coverage

## Usage Notes

This checklist has been **validated by 5 parallel subagents** against actual specification documents (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, tasks.md).

**Validation Methodology**:
- Each section reviewed by specialized subagent
- Cross-referenced against actual document content
- Items confirmed, adjusted, or removed based on evidence
- New gaps identified from document analysis

**How to use revised checklist**:
1. **✅ Confirmed items** (64): These accurately test requirements quality - proceed with validation
2. **🔧 Adjusted items** (34): Review adjustments, update spec/plan documents accordingly
3. **❌ Removed items** (9): Disregard - these tested implementation, not requirements
4. **➕ New items** (12): Critical gaps identified - address before implementation

**Completion threshold**:
- Resolve all 8 critical risk items
- Address ≥90% of adjusted items
- Document remaining items as accepted risks with mitigation

**Resolution Timeline**:

**Phase 1: Priority Items (Completed)**
1. ✅ ~~Review CHK003, CHK004 (constitutional principle coverage)~~ - COMPLETED (FR-021, SC-015 through SC-018 added)
2. ✅ ~~Resolve CHK095, CHK099 (scope ambiguities)~~ - COMPLETED (terminology mapping, scope clarification added)
3. ✅ ~~Specify CHK028 (data loss verification methodology)~~ - COMPLETED (FR-009 verification methodology added)
4. ✅ ~~Address CHK053 (rollback procedures - CRITICAL)~~ - COMPLETED (FR-021 added)
5. ✅ ~~Document CHK069 (edge case dispositions)~~ - COMPLETED (edge case disposition table added)
6. ✅ ~~Document CHK105-CHK106 (traceability matrices)~~ - COMPLETED (added to Known Limitations)
7. ✅ ~~Specify CHK078-CHK079 (tool versions)~~ - COMPLETED (tool version table added to plan.md)
8. ✅ ~~Address CHK044 (database failure modes - CRITICAL)~~ - COMPLETED (US4 scenario #6 + auth failures documented)

**Phase 2: Final Refinements (Completed - 4 Parallel Subagents)**
9. ✅ ~~CHK010, CHK011, CHK019, CHK020, CHK022, CHK101~~ - Performance metrics clarifications (FR-022, FR-023, updated FR-001, SC-001, SC-007, FR-012)
10. ✅ ~~CHK018, CHK024, CHK036, CHK037, CHK058, CHK025~~ - Load testing & test data (FR-024, FR-025, updated FR-007, FR-004, Assumption #7, Measurable Indicators)
11. ✅ ~~CHK033, CHK038, CHK048, CHK051, CHK071, CHK080~~ - Operational requirements (Test Coverage Note, Phase Dependencies update, FR-025, US4 Scenario #4, Logging Schema, Assumption #8)
