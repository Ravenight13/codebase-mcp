## Usage Notes

This checklist is designed for **release readiness assessment** before implementing Phase 06 validation tasks. It tests the **quality of the requirements themselves**, not the implementation.

**How to use**:
1. Review each item sequentially
2. For [Gap] items: Document missing requirements in spec.md or plan.md
3. For [Ambiguity] items: Clarify vague terms with specific definitions
4. For [Conflict] items: Resolve contradictions and update affected documents
5. For [Consistency] items: Align requirements across all specification documents
6. For [Traceability] items: Establish explicit linkages between requirements
7. **Completion threshold**: Resolve all items marked as critical risk priority before implementation
8. **Acceptable state**: ≥90% items resolved; remaining items documented as accepted risks

**Note**: This checklist focuses on constitutional compliance and performance metrics rigor as these are foundational to the feature's success. All performance targets must be measurable, traceable, and sufficient for objective production deployment decisions.
