# Specification Quality Checklist: Performance Validation & Multi-Tenant Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (all 3 clarifications resolved)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

All 3 clarification markers have been resolved with user input:

1. **Q1 - Load Testing Latency Threshold**: Accept degradation to <2000ms p95 under 50-client load (prioritizes availability over performance under extreme stress)
2. **Q2 - Load Test Duration**: 1-hour continuous stress test (catches immediate issues, suitable for CI/CD, achievable within 4-6 hour phase estimate)
3. **Q3 - Baseline Update Procedure**: Hybrid approach - flag regression only if metrics exceed BOTH 10% degradation from baseline AND constitutional targets (allows minor degradation within targets, rejects significant regression)

## Validation Status

**Overall**: âœ… Specification is COMPLETE and READY FOR PLANNING
**Next Step**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan

## Notes

- Specification follows template structure with all mandatory sections
- User scenarios are properly prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- 20 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 14 measurable success criteria, all technology-agnostic
- 10 edge cases identified with specific scenarios
- 7 assumptions documented
- 8 out-of-scope items clearly stated
- Success criteria use specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- No implementation leakage detected
