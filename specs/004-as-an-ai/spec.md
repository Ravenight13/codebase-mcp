# Feature Specification: Optimize list_tasks MCP Tool for Token Efficiency

**Feature Branch**: `004-as-an-ai`
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "As an AI coding assistant using the codebase-mcp server, I need the list_tasks MCP tool to return lightweight task summaries instead of full task details so that I can browse tasks efficiently without loading excessive token counts."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → User needs: lightweight task summaries for efficient browsing
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: AI coding assistants using MCP tools
   → Actions: list tasks, get task details
   → Data: task summaries (id, title, status, timestamps) vs full details
   → Constraints: <2000 tokens for 15 tasks, ~6x reduction from 12000+ tokens
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Minimal clarifications needed - requirements are well-specified
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: list → scan → get details
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Task Summary entity, Full Task entity
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No implementation details included
   → Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10
- Q: What is the migration approach for the breaking change? → A: Immediate breaking change - all clients must update to handle new response format
- Q: When list_tasks database queries fail or timeout, how should the system behave? → A: Return error response with specific error code and message (fail fast)
- Q: What logging and monitoring should be captured for the list_tasks operation? → A: No logging required (internal tool, monitoring not needed)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI coding assistant using the codebase-mcp server, I want to quickly scan available tasks without loading excessive token counts. When I find a task of interest, I want to load its complete details separately. This two-tier browsing approach allows me to efficiently navigate task lists while conserving computational resources.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have 15 tasks in the system, **When** I invoke list_tasks, **Then** the response loads less than 2,000 tokens and includes only task ID, title, status, created timestamp, and updated timestamp for each task
2. **Given** I receive a task summary list, **When** I identify a task I want to learn more about, **Then** I can invoke get_task with the task ID to retrieve complete details including description, notes, planning references, branches, and commits
3. **Given** I need full details for all tasks immediately, **When** I invoke list_tasks with an optional parameter, **Then** I can request full task details in the list response
4. **Given** filtering parameters (status, branch, limit), **When** I invoke list_tasks, **Then** the summary view respects all existing filtering capabilities
5. **Given** I call get_task for a specific task, **When** the task exists, **Then** I receive the complete task object unchanged from current behavior

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a task has no description or notes? (Summary view should still display correctly)
- How does system handle empty task lists? (Should return empty array with zero token overhead)
- What happens when optional full details parameter is true? (Should return complete task objects, accepting higher token count)
- How does performance scale with large task lists (100+ tasks)? (Should maintain <200ms p95 latency)
- What happens when database query fails? (Return error response with specific error code and message - fail fast)
- What happens when database query times out? (Return error response with timeout error code and message)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a list_tasks operation that returns task summaries by default, including only: task ID, title, status, created timestamp, and updated timestamp
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a get_task operation that returns complete task details including description, notes, planning references, branches, and commits
- **FR-003**: System MUST reduce token count for listing 15 tasks from 12,000+ tokens to less than 2,000 tokens (approximately 6x reduction)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support an optional parameter on list_tasks to request full task details when needed
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain existing list_tasks filtering capabilities (by status, by branch, result limit)
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all existing get_task functionality without modification
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain query performance under 200ms p95 latency for list_tasks operations
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all response data with proper schema definitions
- **FR-009**: System MUST update tool documentation to reflect the new summary/detail pattern
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain MCP protocol compliance for all tool responses

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: list_tasks with 15 tasks MUST load less than 2,000 tokens
- **PR-002**: list_tasks query latency MUST remain under 200ms at p95
- **PR-003**: Token reduction MUST achieve approximately 6x improvement (12,000+ → <2,000)
- **PR-004**: Performance optimization MUST NOT degrade get_task operation speed

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: Task summary MUST include: id (UUID), title (string), status (enum), created_at (timestamp), updated_at (timestamp)
- **DR-002**: Full task details MUST include all summary fields PLUS: description (string), notes (string), planning_references (array), branches (array), commits (array)
- **DR-003**: All response schemas MUST be validated with proper type definitions

### Migration & Compatibility Requirements
- **MR-001**: System MUST implement immediate breaking change to list_tasks response format (summary view becomes default)
- **MR-002**: All MCP clients MUST update to handle new response format (no backward compatibility layer provided)
- **MR-003**: Release notes MUST clearly document the breaking change and required client updates

### Error Handling & Reliability Requirements
- **ER-001**: System MUST return specific error response when list_tasks database query fails (fail fast strategy)
- **ER-002**: Error responses MUST include error code and descriptive error message
- **ER-003**: System MUST return specific error response when list_tasks query times out
- **ER-004**: System MUST return specific error response when get_task database query fails
- **ER-005**: Error codes MUST be consistent and documented for client error handling

### Observability & Monitoring Requirements
- **OM-001**: No logging or monitoring requirements for list_tasks or get_task operations (internal tool scope)
- **OM-002**: System MAY rely on existing infrastructure-level logging if available, but no application-level logging is required

### Key Entities

- **Task Summary**: Lightweight representation of a task for browsing purposes
  - Attributes: ID, title, status, created timestamp, updated timestamp
  - Purpose: Efficient task list scanning with minimal token usage
  - Relationship: Subset of Full Task entity

- **Full Task**: Complete task representation with all metadata
  - Attributes: All Task Summary fields plus description, notes, planning references, git branches, git commits
  - Purpose: Detailed task information for decision-making and implementation
  - Relationship: Superset of Task Summary entity

## Business Value

### Problem Statement
AI coding assistants using the codebase-mcp server currently experience poor performance when browsing task lists. Loading 15 tasks consumes over 12,000 tokens, making simple browsing operations expensive and slow. This creates a poor user experience and wastes computational resources.

### Value Proposition
By implementing a two-tier browsing pattern (summary list + detailed view), users can:
- **Reduce computational cost by 6x** for task browsing operations
- **Improve response times** by loading only necessary data
- **Enable efficient task scanning** without sacrificing access to detailed information
- **Follow established API design patterns** (list returns summaries, get returns details)

### Success Metrics
- Token usage for 15-task list: <2,000 tokens (down from 12,000+)
- Query latency: <200ms p95 for list operations
- User satisfaction: Faster task browsing with no loss of functionality
