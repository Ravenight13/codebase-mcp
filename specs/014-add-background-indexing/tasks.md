# Tasks: Background Indexing for Large Repositories

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/014-add-background-indexing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and database schema setup

- [ ] T001 Create database migration for indexing_jobs and job_events tables in alembic/versions/015_add_background_indexing.py
- [ ] T002 [P] Create IndexingJob SQLAlchemy model in src/models/indexing_job.py
- [ ] T003 [P] Create JobEvent SQLAlchemy model in src/models/indexing_job.py

- [ ] T005 Run database migration to create indexing_jobs and job_events tables

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core background job infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Create progress callback type and helper functions in src/services/background_indexing.py
- [ ] T008 Add optional progress_callback parameter to index_repository() in src/services/indexer.py (backward compatible, research.md Decision 7)
- [ ] T009 Implement progress callback invocations at scanning (10%), chunking (10-50%), embedding (50-90%), writing (90-100%) phases in src/services/indexer.py
- [ ] T010 [P] Create background job service skeleton with asyncio.Task management in src/services/background_indexing.py
- [ ] T011 [P] Implement checkpoint save/load logic using metadata JSONB column in src/services/background_indexing.py
- [ ] T012 Implement concurrency control with MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=3 limit in src/services/background_indexing.py (research.md Decision 6)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Index Large Repositories Without Interruption (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enable indexing of 15K+ file repositories in background without blocking MCP client, with real-time progress tracking and completion summary

**Independent Test**: Start indexing on 15K+ file repository, verify user receives immediate confirmation (<1s), job completes successfully in background with accurate summary

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- FR-001: Automatic detection when estimated duration >60s
- FR-002: Job ID returned in <1s
- FR-006: Status queries in <100ms

**Checkpoint**: All core user stories (US1, US2, US3) should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Resume Indexing After Interruptions (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Automatically resume interrupted jobs on server restart from last checkpoint with <1% duplicate work

**Independent Test**: Start job, interrupt server mid-execution, restart server, verify job auto-resumes in <10s with <1% duplicate work

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- FR-009: Auto-resume within 10s of restart
- FR-010: <1% duplicate work via checkpoints every 500 files or 30s
- SC-003: Resume <10s, <1% duplicate work

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US3)
- **Tests (Phase 7-8)**: Can run in parallel, depend on corresponding implementation phases
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - **MVP TARGET**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 with enhanced monitoring
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Adds cancellation to US1
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Adds resumption to US1

### Within Each User Story

- Core implementation before integration
- Services before MCP tools
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: T002, T003, T004 (different models/schemas)
- **Phase 2**: T006, T010, T011 (different services/modules)
- **Phase 7**: T038-T046 (all integration tests)
- **Phase 8**: T047-T054 (all contract and unit tests)
- **Phase 9**: T059, T060 (logging and monitoring)
- **Across User Stories**: US1, US2, US3, US4 can be worked on in parallel by different developers after Foundational phase

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Core implementation tasks that can run in parallel (different files):
Task T013: "Implement start_indexing_background() MCP tool in src/server.py"
Task T014: "Implement _background_worker() function in src/services/background_indexing.py"
Task T015: "Implement _update_job_progress() helper in src/services/background_indexing.py"

# Must run sequentially:
T017 ‚Üí T013 (job creation helper before MCP tool)
T018 ‚Üí T014 (event logging before worker)
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005) - Database schema ready
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T012) - Core infrastructure ready (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T020) - Background indexing functional
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run Scenario 1 integration test (T039)
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T012)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!) (T013-T020 + T039)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T021-T025 + T040)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T032-T037 + T042)
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (T026-T031 + T041)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T012)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T013-T020)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T021-T025)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (T032-T037)
   - Developer D: User Story 3 (T026-T031)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitutional compliance maintained throughout:
  - Principle I: Simplicity (asyncio-only, no external queues)
  - Principle II: Local-First (PostgreSQL state, offline-capable)
  - Principle IV: Performance (<1s job creation, <100ms queries, <5s cancellation)
  - Principle V: Production Quality (comprehensive error handling, type safety)
  - Principle VIII: Pydantic Type Safety (all models use Pydantic, mypy --strict)
