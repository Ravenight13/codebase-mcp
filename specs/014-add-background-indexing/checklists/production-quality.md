**Purpose**: Validate requirements quality for production-grade background indexing feature
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Domain**: Production Quality & Reliability

## Checklist Methodology

This checklist tests **requirements writing quality**, not implementation correctness. Each item validates that the specification itself is complete, clear, consistent, measurable, and unambiguous.

**Scoring**:
- ✅ **PASS**: Requirement meets quality standard
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Requirement needs minor clarification or improvement
- ❌ **FAIL**: Critical gap or ambiguity requiring spec revision

---

## 1. Requirement Completeness

### 1.1 Lifecycle Coverage

- [ ] **Are all 6 job lifecycle states clearly defined with descriptions?**
  - Referenced: FR-004 (pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled, blocked)
  - Test: Can a developer implement state transitions without asking "what does 'blocked' mean?"
  - Gap Check: Are state transition rules specified? (e.g., can cancelled → running?)

- [ ] **Are state transition rules documented for all valid/invalid transitions?**
  - Referenced: Key Entities - Background Job invariants
  - Test: "Job cannot transition from completed/failed/cancelled states back to running"
  - Gap Check: What about pending → blocked? running → blocked?

- [ ] **Are all error scenarios identified with recovery behavior?**
  - Referenced: Edge Cases (database loss, embedding service outage, storage exhaustion)
  - Test: Each edge case includes "What happens when" + resolution
  - Gap Check: Missing scenarios? (network errors, permission errors, corrupted files)

### 1.2 Performance Requirements

- [ ] **Are all performance metrics quantified with specific targets?**
  - Referenced: FR-002 (1s), FR-006 (100ms), FR-007 (200ms), FR-008 (5s), FR-009 (10s)
  - Test: No vague terms like "fast", "quickly", "responsive"
  - Gap Check: Missing metrics? (checkpoint write latency, queue wait time)

- [ ] **Are performance requirements consistent across all sections?**
  - Cross-reference: FR-001 (60s trigger) vs A-002 (60s threshold) vs SC-006 (constitutional 60s target)
  - Test: All 3 references use same 60-second value
  - Gap Check: Any conflicting timing values?

- [ ] **Are performance degradation scenarios addressed?**
  - Referenced: FR-011 (3 concurrent jobs without degradation), SC-006
  - Test: Spec defines what "without degradation" means (each job meets same targets)
  - Gap Check: What happens with 4+ concurrent jobs? (queued - FR-011 acceptance criteria)

### 1.3 Recovery & Resilience

- [ ] **Are checkpoint frequency requirements specified?**
  - Referenced: FR-010 (<1% duplicate work), User Story 4 Scenario 2
  - Test: Measurable outcome defined (1% threshold)
  - Gap Check: Is checkpoint frequency interval specified? (Not in spec, deferred to implementation)

- [ ] **Are automatic recovery requirements complete?**
  - Referenced: FR-009 (auto-resume within 10s), FR-010 (checkpoint-based recovery)
  - Test: All aspects covered (detection, resumption timing, duplicate prevention)
  - Gap Check: What if database corruption? (Not specified - edge case missing?)

- [ ] **Are failure recovery requirements defined for all edge cases?**
  - Referenced: Edge Cases (6 scenarios with recovery behavior)
  - Test: Each edge case includes expected outcome
  - Gap Check: All edge cases have actionable resolution (yes - pause/retry, cleanup, etc.)

---

## 2. Requirement Clarity

### 2.1 Terminology Consistency

- [ ] **Is terminology used consistently throughout?**
  - Test: "background job" vs "background operation" vs "async task" vs "indexing task"
  - Review: FR-001 (operation), FR-002 (operation), FR-004 (operation), Key Entities (Background Job), User Stories (task)
  - Finding: Minor inconsistency - "operation" in FRs, "job" in entities, "task" in stories

- [ ] **Are all domain terms defined before use?**
  - Check: "Background Job", "Job Checkpoint", "Job Event" defined in Key Entities
  - Test: First use of each term has definition or reference
  - Gap Check: "MCP client timeout" used in FR-001 - defined in A-001 (good)

### 2.2 Ambiguity Detection

- [ ] **Are all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved?**
  - Count: 3 markers in initial draft
  - Status: All 3 resolved in Clarifications section (Session 2025-10-17)
  - Test: Search spec for remaining markers (none found)

- [ ] **Are requirements unambiguous with single valid interpretation?**
  - FR-005 test: "every 10 seconds or every 100 work units completed, whichever occurs first"
  - Analysis: Clear - uses specific numbers and precedence rule (whichever first)
  - FR-008 test: "stops gracefully within 5 seconds"
  - Analysis: Potential ambiguity - what if can't stop gracefully? (Acceptance criteria clarifies: "completes current batch")

- [ ] **Are all acceptance criteria objectively testable?**
  - FR-010: "<1% of work is repeated after restart"
  - Test: Yes - can measure files processed before/after restart and calculate percentage
  - SC-008: "95% of users understand job status"
  - Test: Measurable but requires user study (acceptable for UX success criteria)

### 2.3 Prerequisite Clarity

- [ ] **Are all prerequisites and dependencies identified?**
  - Referenced: Assumptions section (A-003: Ollama embedding service), Scope Clarity checklist
  - Test: Dependencies listed (database, embedding service, existing indexing logic)
  - Gap Check: Missing dependencies? (file system access, network for multi-project setups)

---

## 3. Requirement Consistency

  - Test: No conflicts (different contexts: trigger vs response vs cancellation vs recovery)
  - Gap Check: FR-001 (60s) + FR-009 (10s resume) = 70s total worst case - acceptable

- [ ] **Are lifecycle state requirements consistent with invariants?**
  - FR-004: 6 states (pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled, blocked)
  - Key Entities invariant: "Job cannot transition from completed/failed/cancelled states back to running"
  - Test: States align, transition rules defined
  - Gap Check: What triggers "blocked" state? (Not specified - potential gap)

- [ ] **Are concurrency requirements consistent across sections?**
  - FR-011: "up to 3 concurrent operations"
  - SC-006: "3 concurrent background jobs"
  - User Story 2 Scenario 4: "multiple indexing tasks"

  - SC-008 → FR-005, FR-006 (progress updates, status queries)
  - Test: All 8 success criteria have clear FR mappings ✅

- [ ] **Are success criteria measurable with acceptance tests?**
  - SC-003 test: "<1% duplicate work" - requires before/after file count comparison
  - SC-007 test: "<2% failure rate" - requires historical job completion tracking
  - SC-008 test: "95% user understanding" - requires user study
  - Test: All criteria have measurement methodology (some require user testing)

---

## 7. Dependencies & Assumptions

### 7.1 Dependency Clarity

- [ ] **Are all external dependencies identified?**
  - A-003: Ollama embedding service (local)
  - A-004: Database storage capacity
  - Implicit: File system access, existing indexing logic
  - Test: Dependencies listed with availability assumptions
  - Gap Check: Version requirements? (Not specified - deferred to technical implementation)

- [ ] **Are dependency failure scenarios covered?**
  - Edge Cases: Embedding service unavailable → wait and retry
  - Edge Cases: Database connectivity loss → pause/resume
  - Edge Cases: Storage exhaustion → clean stop
  - Test: All 3 critical dependencies have failure handling ✅

### 7.2 Assumption Validity

- [ ] **Are all assumptions documented and reasonable?**
  - 8 assumptions (A-001 through A-008) with clear rationale
  - A-001: MCP timeout 30s (validated empirically)
  - A-002: 60s threshold (aligns with constitutional target + 2x safety margin)
  - A-003: Ollama local + transient failures (realistic for local-first)
  - A-005: Infrequent restarts (reasonable for dev environment)
  - Test: Each assumption includes justification or validation approach ✅

- [ ] **Do assumptions conflict with requirements?**
  - A-005 (infrequent restarts) vs FR-009 (auto-resume required)
  - Analysis: No conflict - FR-009 handles infrequent but critical scenario
  - A-006 (polling model) vs Non-Goals (no WebSocket)
  - Analysis: Consistent - polling is simpler than WebSocket ✅

---

## 8. Ambiguities & Conflicts

### 8.1 Remaining Ambiguities

- [ ] **Are there unresolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers?**
  - Search: `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION:`
  - Findings: 0 markers (all 3 resolved in Clarifications section)
  - Test: All ambiguities addressed through clarification phase ✅

- [ ] **Are there implicit assumptions requiring validation?**
  - FR-011: "3 concurrent jobs" - why 3? (Clarifications: based on testing)
  - FR-010: "<1% duplicate work" - is this achievable? (Depends on checkpoint frequency)
  - A-005: "< 1 per day restarts" - realistic? (Deferred to operational validation)
  - Finding: Minor implicit assumptions exist but acceptable for spec phase

### 8.2 Requirement Conflicts

- [ ] **Are there contradictory requirements across sections?**
  - Cross-check: FR-005 (every 10s or 100 units) vs FR-010 (<1% duplicates)
  - Analysis: Not contradictory - different contexts (progress updates vs checkpoint saves)
  - Cross-check: FR-008 (5s graceful stop) vs FR-005 (10s update frequency)
  - Analysis: Consistent - can stop between updates (completes current batch)
  - Test: No contradictions found ✅

- [ ] **Are success criteria achievable given constraints?**
  - SC-003: <1% duplicate work with 10s auto-resume (FR-009)
  - Analysis: Requires frequent checkpoints (FR-010) - achievable with proper design
  - SC-006: 3 concurrent jobs without degradation
  - Analysis: Requires resource budgeting (connection pools, CPU) - feasible with testing
  - Test: All success criteria are challenging but achievable ✅

---

## 9. Constitutional Alignment

### 9.1 Principle Compliance

- [ ] **Principle I: Simplicity Over Features**
  - Evidence: 15-item Non-Goals section prevents scope creep
  - Evidence: Background jobs solve single problem (timeout for large repos)
  - Test: No feature complexity beyond core requirement ✅

- [ ] **Principle II: Local-First Architecture**
  - Evidence: FR-003 (local storage), A-003 (local Ollama), Non-Goals (no cloud)
  - Evidence: A-006 (polling vs WebSocket), FR-009 (offline recovery)
  - Test: All state persisted locally, no cloud dependencies ✅

- [ ] **Principle III: Protocol Compliance (MCP)**
  - Evidence: FR-006 (status via MCP tools), FR-014 (structured logging)
  - Evidence: FR-001 (non-blocking async execution)
  - Test: Jobs accessed via MCP tools, no protocol violations ✅

- [ ] **Principle IV: Performance Guarantees**
  - Evidence: SC-006 (maintain 60s indexing, 500ms search during concurrent jobs)
  - Evidence: FR-002 (1s job creation), FR-006 (100ms status query)
  - Test: All timing targets defined, constitutional baselines preserved ✅

- [ ] **Principle V: Production Quality Standards**
  - Evidence: FR-014 (comprehensive event logging), SC-007 (<2% failure rate)
  - Evidence: FR-008 (graceful cancellation), FR-010 (checkpoint recovery)
  - Evidence: Edge Cases (6 failure scenarios with recovery)
  - Test: Error handling, logging, recovery all specified ✅

- [ ] **Principle VI: Specification-First Development**
  - Evidence: This spec defines WHAT/WHY before implementation (HOW)
  - Evidence: All acceptance criteria defined upfront
  - Test: Spec complete before planning phase ✅

- [ ] **Principle VII: Test-Driven Development**
  - Evidence: Each user story includes "Independent Test" section
  - Evidence: 16 Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios across 4 stories
  - Evidence: Success criteria are measurable (SC-001 through SC-008)
  - Test: Test scenarios defined before implementation ✅

- [ ] **Principle VIII: Pydantic-Based Type Safety**
  - Evidence: Key Entities define structured data (Background Job, Checkpoint, Event)
  - Evidence: FR-015 (validation at system boundaries)
  - Note: Implementation details deferred to planning phase (appropriate)
  - Test: Specification anticipates type-safe models ✅

### 9.2 Complexity Justification

- [ ] **Is any introduced complexity justified?**
  - Complexity: Background job infrastructure (new tables, async workers)
  - Justification: Constitutional performance targets (60s) impossible for 15K+ file repos without background processing
  - Alternatives considered: Streaming (too complex), distributed (violates local-first), blocking (violates MCP timeout)
  - Test: Complexity serves constitutional compliance rather than violating it ✅

- [ ] **Are complexity trade-offs documented?**
  - Trade-off: Polling (simple) vs WebSocket (real-time but complex)
  - Decision: Polling chosen (Non-Goals: no WebSocket streaming)
  - Trade-off: Fixed 3-job limit vs dynamic scheduling
  - Decision: Fixed limit (simpler, testable, sufficient for MVP)
  - Test: Trade-offs align with Principle I (Simplicity) ✅

### Critical Findings (Initial Review - Before Fixes)

**Critical Issues (1 FAIL)**:
1. **State transition rules missing** (Category 1.1.2) - Only one transition rule specified, missing rules for blocked state, cancellation timing, and recovery flows

**High Priority Issues (5 WARN)**:
2. **State terminology inconsistency** (Categories 1.1.1, 3.1.2) - FR-004 defines 6 states (pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled, blocked) but Key Entities line 165 uses 5 different states (pending, active, finished, error, stopped)
3. **"Blocked" state undefined** (Categories 1.1.1, 8.2.1) - Referenced in FR-004 and FR-009 but never explained what triggers it
4. **A-005 conflicts with FR-009** (Categories 7.2.1, 7.2.2) - Recovery called "nice-to-have" but FR-009 makes it MUST requirement
5. **Checkpoint frequency not in FR-010** (Categories 1.3.1, 8.1.2) - Frequency "every 500 files or 30 seconds" appears in entity description (line 179) but not in FR-010 requirement
6. **Terminology inconsistency throughout** (Category 2.1.1) - "operation" vs "job" vs "task" used interchangeably

**Medium Priority Issues (13 WARN)**:
7. Missing edge cases: permission errors, corrupted files, multiple crashes (Categories 1.1.3, 5.2.1)
8. Data retention gaps for checkpoints/events (Category 6.1.1)
9. Observability requirements lack operational detail (Category 6.1.2)
10. File system access not explicitly listed as dependency (Category 7.1.1)
11. 3-job limit needs rationale documentation (Category 8.1.2)
12. Resource budgeting not documented (Category 8.2.2)
13. SC-008 measurement methodology needs clarification (Category 3.2.2)
