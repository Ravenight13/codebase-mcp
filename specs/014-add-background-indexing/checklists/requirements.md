**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17 (Post-Revision Validation)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Revision History

**Initial Draft** (2025-10-17 10:00): First version had 8 critical compliance violations
**Revision 1** (2025-10-17 11:30): Parallel subagent revision addressed all critical issues
**Final Validation** (2025-10-17 12:00): **✅ PASS - All criteria met**

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Zero mentions of PostgreSQL, threads, schemas, enums, JSONB, Python, FastMCP, or SQLAlchemy
- ✅ User Stories describe user experience ("user needs to index", "user can check status") not system behavior
- ✅ Functional Requirements focus on WHAT (capabilities) not HOW (implementation)
- ✅ All 10 mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Key Entities, Success Criteria, Non-Goals, Clarifications, Assumptions, Review Checklist, Edge Cases, Feature Metadata

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3 with valid reason)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Exactly 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (max allowed):
  1. FR-001: MCP client timeout limit validation (architecturally significant)
  2. FR-001: Threshold trigger logic - files vs lines vs duration (affects core design)
  3. FR-011: Maximum concurrent operations limit (resource management strategy)
- ✅ All 15 Functional Requirements include Acceptance Criteria and trace to User Stories
- ✅ Success Criteria use specific metrics (1 second, 5 seconds, 100ms, <1%, <2%, 95%)
- ✅ Edge Cases (6 scenarios) describe user-facing behavior without technical implementation
- ✅ Non-Goals section (15 items) clearly bounds scope to prevent feature creep
- ✅ Assumptions section (A-001 through A-008) documents reasonable defaults, A-002 contradiction resolved

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ 4 prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3, P2) with independent testability
- ✅ Each user story includes "Why this priority" justification and "Independent Test" description
- ✅ 26 Given-When-Then acceptance scenarios across all user stories
- ✅ Key Entities transformed to business entities with Purpose, Lifecycle, Attributes, Invariants, Relationships
- ✅ Success Criteria align with user stories: SC-001→US1, SC-005→US2, SC-004→US3, SC-003→US4

## Constitutional Compliance

- [x] Aligns with **Principle I: Simplicity Over Features** - Background jobs solve timeout problem only, Non-Goals prevents scope creep
- [x] Aligns with **Principle II: Local-First Architecture** - No cloud dependencies, local job tracking (FR-003)
- [x] Aligns with **Principle III: Protocol Compliance** - Job status via MCP tools, structured logging (FR-014)
- [x] Aligns with **Principle IV: Performance Guarantees** - Maintains 60s/10K lines target during concurrent jobs (SC-006)
- [x] Aligns with **Principle V: Production Quality Standards** - Error handling (FR-014), graceful failure (SC-007), clear messages
- [x] Aligns with **Principle VI: Specification-First Development** - Acceptance criteria before implementation
- [x] Aligns with **Principle VII: Test-Driven Development** - Test scenarios in User Stories
- [x] Respects Technical Constraints - Works with existing async architecture, PostgreSQL database (but not specified in spec)

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Review Checklist section (lines 266-301) includes Constitutional Compliance subsection with 9 principle checks
- ✅ Non-Goals explicitly references constitutional principles (e.g., "Single-user local operation - inherited from Local-First Architecture principle")
- ✅ Success Criteria SC-006 references "constitutional performance targets" maintaining alignment
- ✅ No violations detected during final validation

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED - Ready for `/speckit.clarify`**

**Overall Assessment**:
The specification has been successfully revised using parallel subagents to address all 8 critical compliance violations identified in the initial review. The spec now demonstrates exemplary adherence to spec-kit methodology with complete separation of WHAT/WHY (specification) from HOW (implementation).

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Implementation Details Eliminated**: All technology references (PostgreSQL, threads, schemas) replaced with user-centric language
2. **Mandatory Sections Added**: Non-Goals, Clarifications, and Review Checklist sections now present
3. **Business Entities Transformed**: Key Entities section describes business concepts with lifecycle and invariants, not database schema
4. **User-Centric Stories**: User Stories focus on user experience and outcomes, not system internals
5. **Technology-Agnostic Requirements**: All 15 FRs describe capabilities without specifying implementation approach
6. **Strategic Clarifications**: 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers address high-impact architectural decisions
7. **Assumption Clarity**: A-002 contradiction resolved, threshold logic clearly defined
8. **Edge Case Quality**: All 6 edge cases describe observable user behavior without technical implementation

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Content Quality: 4/4 ✅
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 ✅
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 ✅
- Constitutional Compliance: 8/8 ✅
- Structural Compliance: 10/10 sections (100%)

**Estimated Revision Time**: 2.5 hours (5 parallel subagents + integration + validation)

**Readiness**: The specification is production-ready for the clarification phase. The 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are strategically placed to resolve genuine ambiguities that affect core architectural decisions:
- Q1: MCP client timeout empirical validation
- Q2: Background indexing threshold logic (files/lines/duration)
- Q3: Concurrent operations resource limits

**Recommended Next Step**: `/speckit.clarify` to resolve marked ambiguities through structured questioning, then proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.
