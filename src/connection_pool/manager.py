class PoolState(str, Enum):
    """Connection pool lifecycle states.

    This enum represents the internal state of a connection pool throughout its
    lifecycle, from initialization to termination. State transitions are managed
    by the ConnectionPoolManager to ensure consistent lifecycle behavior.

    **State Definitions**:

    - INITIALIZING: Pool is being created and establishing min_size connections.
      No connections are available for use yet. Failed initialization transitions
      to UNHEALTHY.

    - HEALTHY: Pool is operating optimally with >=80% idle capacity, no recent
      errors (last 60 seconds), and normal wait times (<100ms). All connections
      are functioning correctly.

    - DEGRADED: Pool is functional but under stress. Conditions include:
      * 50-79% idle capacity (some connection pressure)
      * Recent errors within last 60 seconds
      * High wait times (>100ms peak)
      * Some connections failed but recovery possible

    - UNHEALTHY: Pool is critically compromised. Conditions include:
      * Zero total connections (complete failure)
      * <50% idle capacity (severe connection exhaustion)
      * Initialization failed
      * Critical error preventing connection establishment

    - RECOVERING: Pool is attempting to recover from UNHEALTHY state through
      reconnection attempts. This is a transient state during self-healing.
      Successful recovery transitions to HEALTHY; failed recovery returns to
      UNHEALTHY.

    - SHUTTING_DOWN: Graceful shutdown initiated. Pool stops accepting new
      requests, waits for active connections to complete, then closes all
      connections. Triggered by explicit shutdown signal or server termination.

    - TERMINATED: Pool has completed shutdown. All connections closed, resources
      released, and pool can no longer be used. This is a terminal state.

    **State Transitions**:

    Normal Lifecycle Flow:
    - INITIALIZING -> HEALTHY: Successfully created min_size connections
    - HEALTHY -> DEGRADED: Partial capacity or minor errors detected
    - DEGRADED -> UNHEALTHY: Critical capacity drop (<50%) or severe errors
    - UNHEALTHY -> RECOVERING: Self-healing reconnection attempt started
    - RECOVERING -> HEALTHY: Successful reconnection restored capacity

    Recovery Cycles:
    - RECOVERING -> UNHEALTHY: Recovery failed, may retry
    - DEGRADED -> HEALTHY: Capacity restored or errors cleared

    Shutdown Flow:
    - {HEALTHY|DEGRADED|UNHEALTHY} -> SHUTTING_DOWN: Shutdown signal received
    - SHUTTING_DOWN -> TERMINATED: All connections closed, cleanup complete

class ConnectionPoolManager:

    This class manages the lifecycle of an asyncpg connection pool with comprehensive
    health monitoring, statistics tracking, and structured logging. It provides a
    production-grade pool management solution with <2 second initialization time
    and <10ms health check latency.

    **Features**:
    - Parallel connection validation during initialization (<2s target)
    - Real-time statistics tracking (<1ms get_statistics() latency)
    - Health checks with automatic status calculation (<10ms p99)
    - Structured logging to /tmp/codebase-mcp.log (no stdout pollution)
    - Type-safe configuration with Pydantic validation
    - Graceful shutdown with connection draining

    **Constitutional Compliance**:
    - Principle IV (Performance): <2s initialization, <10ms health checks
    - Principle V (Production Quality): Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Principle VIII (Type Safety): Full mypy --strict compliance

    - Statistics retrieval: <1ms (synchronous, no locks)
    - Health check: <10ms p99 (includes statistics + status calculation)

        Returns an immutable snapshot of current pool state including connection

        **Performance Target**: <1ms (no locks, no await, atomic reads)

        **Statistics Included**:
        - Connection counts (total, idle, active, waiting)
        - Lifetime metrics (acquisitions, releases)
        - Performance metrics (avg acquisition time, peak metrics)
        - Timestamps (pool created, last health check)

        **Performance Target**: <10ms p99 (includes statistics + status calculation)
